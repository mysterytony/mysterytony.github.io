# Ten Principles of Economics

## In This Chapter, Look for the Answers to These Questions:

* What kinds opf questions does economics address?
* What are the principles of how people make decisions?
* What are the principles of how people interact?
* What are the principles pof how the economy as a whole works? -- We will leave this question for Macroeconomics.

## What Economics is All About

* The word economy comes from the Greek word for "one who manages a household."
* **Microeconomics** deals with the study of
	* individual households and firms
	* equilibrium in particular markets
	* relative prices
* **Macroeconomics** deals with the study of economics aggregates such as
	* inflation
	* unemployment
	* and economic growth
* **Scarcity** refers to the limited nature of society's resources. Since the resources are limited, people cannot produce all the goods and services they wish to have.
* **Economics** is the study of how society manges its scarce resources, including
	* how people decides how much to work, save, and spend, and what to buy
	* how firms decide how much to produce, how many workers to hire
	* how society decides how to decide its resources between national defense, consumer goods, protecting the environment, and other needs.

## In Microeconomics We Are Mainly Interested in

* The study of the allocation of **scarce** resources which are resources with alternative uses.
* Notes: by scarce we do NOT mean there is a shortage of something; rather we mean that virtually everything has an alternative use and if we use it for one thing, we cannot use it for another.
* Scarcity arises from a combination of large human wants or desires and limited resources to attain them.

## How People Make Decisions

* We will examine 8 main principles regarding to economy.
* Both households and societies face many decisions because resources are scarce.
* The first four principles deal with how people make decisions.

### **Principle #1: People Face Tradeoffs**

All decisions involve tradeoffs. Examples:

* Going to a party the night before your midterm leaves less time for studying.
* Having more money to buy stuff requires working longer hours, which leaves less time for leisure.
* Protecting the environment requires resources that might otherwise be used to produce consumer goods.

* Society face an important tradeoff:

***efficiency vs. equity***

* **Efficiency**: getting the most out of scarce resources
* **Equity**: distributing prosperity fairly among society's members.
* Tradeoff: to increase equity, we can redistribute income from the well-off to the poor (welfare system, employment insurance, individual income tax).
* It reduces the incentive to work and produce, and shrinks the size of the economic "pie."

This does not mean that we should *not* engage in redistribution. The poor should not be ignored just because helping them distorts work incentives. Rather it means that we could:

* Redistribute in ways that cause the least efficiency loss
* Make informed decision about how much redistribution we are prepared to allow

### **Principle #2: The Cost of Something is What You Give Up to Get It**

* Making decisions requires comparing the costs and benefits of alternative choices.
* The **opportunity cost** of an item is whatever must be given up to obtain it.
* It is the relevant cost for decision making.
* The costs
	* of using resources for a particular purpose
	* are measured by the benefit of not using them
	* are determined by the amount in the resources' **next best alternative** use
* An opportunity cost can only arise when we take an action. If we do one thing or buy one thing, then we cannot do or buy something else at the same time or with the same money.
* The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item.
* Opportunity costs include
	* explicit costs (out of pocket expenses)
	* implicit costs (such as foregone earnings)
* Do not include
	* **sunk costs** (unrecoverable costs)
	* costs that must be incurred regardless of which course of action is taken
	* the sunk cost is an economic term for a sum paid, in the past, which is no longer relevant to decisions about the future
* Decision making: a firm/person should engage in activity if the benefits exceeds the opportunity cost.
* Explicit costs are usually easy to see since they are connected with specific costs which we pay.
* Some costs are hidden:
	* If I choose to take a 4 week holiday, then the opportunity costs include what I pay explicitly for the travel, lodgings, food, sight-seeing, etc, but there is also a cost in time (implicit cost). In addition, costs of food would be incurred even if I did not travel so are not really opportunity costs.

### **Principle #3: Rational People Think at the Margin**

* A person is **rational** if she systematically and purposefully does the best she can to achieve her objectives.
* Many decisions are not "all or nothing," but involve **marginal changes** -- incremental adjustments to an existing plan.
* Evaluating the costs and benefits of marginal changes is an important part of decision making.
* Marginal decision making can help explain a puzzling economic phenomena: Why is water so cheap, while diamonds are so expensive? Human need water to survive, while diamonds are unnecessary.
* The reason is that a person's willingness to pay for a good is based on the marginal benefit that an extra unit of the good will yield.
* The marginal benefit depends on how many units a person already has. Water is essential but the marginal benefit of an extra cup is small because water is plentiful.
* By contrast, no one needs diamonds to survive, but because diamonds are so rare, people consider the marginal benefit of an tra diamond to be large.

### **Principle #4: People Respond to Incentives**

* **incentive**: something that induces a person to act, i.e. the prospect of a reward or punishment.
* Rational people respond to incentives because they make decisions by comparing costs and benefits.

## How People Interact

* An economy is just a group of people interacting with each other.
* The next three principles deal with how people interact.

### **Principle #5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off**

* Rather than being self-sufficient, people can specialize in producing one good service and exchange it for other goods.
* Countries also benefit from trade & specialization:
	* get a better price abroad for goods they produce
	* buy other goods more cheaply from abroad than could be produced at home

### **Principle #6: Markets Are Usually A Good Way to Organize Economy Activity**

* A **market** is a group of buyers and sellers. (They need not to be in a single location.)
* "Organize economic activity" means determining
	* what goods to produce
	* how to produce them
	* how much of each to produce
	* who gets them
* In a market economy, these decisions result from the interactions of many households and firms.
* Famous insight by Adam Smith in *The Wealth of Nations* (1776): Each of these households and firms acts as if "led by **an invisible hand**" to promote general economic well-being. Participants in the economy are motivated by self-interest and that the "invisible hand" of the market place guides this self interest into promoting general economic well-being. By pursuing their own interest, individuals frequently promote that of the society more effectively than when they really intend to promote it.
* The invisible hand works through the price system:
	* The interaction of buyers and sellers determines prices of goods and services.
	* Each price reflects the good's value to buyers and the cost of producing the good.
	* Prices guide self-interested households and firms to make decisions that, in many cases, maximize society's economic well-being.
* However as we will study later, sometimes markets fail.
* Market failures can come from:
	* Lack of competition - e.g. monopoly
	* Externalities - e.g. pollution, fire-proofing a home
	* Lack of information
	* Public goods - goods that are consumed jointly by many people like national defence. It is difficult that the benefits of national defense can be split up and distributed as individual parcels to people.

### **Principle #7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes**

* Market work only if property rights are enforced.
* Important role of government: enforce property rights (police, courts, law)
* People are less inclined to work, produce, or invest of there is large risk of their property being stolen.
* The invisible hand is powerful but it is not omnipotent. There are 2 reasons for a government to intervene in the economy and change the allocation of resources:
	1. to promote efficiency (enlarge the economic pie)
	2. to promote equity (change how the pie is divided)
* Government may alter market outcome to promote efficiency
* **Market failure**, when the market fails to allocate society's resources efficiently, Causes:
	* **externalities**, when the production or consumption of a good affect bystanders (e.g. pollution)
	* **market power**, a single buyer or seller has substantial influence on market price (e.g. monopoly)
* In such cases, public policy may increase efficiency.
* Government may alter market outcome to promote equity
* The invisible hand may fail to ensure that economic prosperity is distributed equitably.
* A market economy reward people according to their ability to produce things that other people are willing to pay for.
* The invisible hand does not ensure that everyone has sufficient good, decent clothing and adequate health care.
* If the market's distribution of economic well-being is not desirable, tax or welfare policies can change how the economic "pie" is divided.

### **Principle #8: A Country's Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods & Services**

* The most important determinant of living standards: **productivity**, the amount of goods and services produced for each hour of a worker's time.
* The growth rate of a nation's productivity determines the growth rate of its average income.
* Productivity depends on the equipment, skills, and technology available to workers.
* Other factors (e.g., labour unions, competition from abroad) have far less impact on living standards.

## Conclusion

* Economic offers many insights about the behavior of people, markets, and economies.
* It is  based on a few ideas that can be applied in many situations.
* We will refer back to some of the ***8 Principles*** from this chapter later on.
