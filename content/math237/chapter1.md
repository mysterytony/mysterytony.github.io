# Chapter 1: Graphs of Scalar Functions

## 1.1 Scalar Functions

Recall that a function
$$f:A\rightarrow B$$
associates with each element $a\in A$ a unique element $f(a)\in B$ called the **image** of $a$ under $f$. The set $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$ and is denoted $D(f)$. The set $B$ is called the **codomain** of $f$. The subset of $B$ consisting of all $f(a)$ is called the **range** of $f$ and is denoted $R(f)$.

#### Definition
A **scalar function** $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ of $n$-variables is a function whose domain is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and whose range is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

## 1.2 Geometric Interpretation of $z=f(x,y)$

We define the **graph** of a function $f(x,y)$ as the set of all points $(a,b,f(a,b))$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $(a,b)\in D(f)$. Notice that we can now think of $f(a,b)$ as representing the height of the surface $z=f(x,y)$ above $(x,y)=(a,b)$.

#### Definition
The **level curves** of a function $f$ are the curves
$$f(x,y)=k$$
where $k$ is a constant in the range of $f$.

#### Remark
Observe that the level curve $f(x,y)=k$ is the intersection of $z=f(x,y)$ and the horizontal plane $z=k$. Thus, in our family of level curves, each value of $k$ represents the height of that level curve above the $xy$-plane.

#### Definition
The **cross sections** of a surface $z=f(x,y)$ are the family of curves given by
$$z=f(c,y)$$ or $$z=f(x,d)$$

#### Generalization

#### Definition
For a scalar function $f(x,y,z)$, we call the family of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$
$$f(x,y,z)=k, \quad k\in R(f)$$
the **level surfaces** of $f$.

#### Definition
For a scalar function $f(x), \quad x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ we call the equations
$$f(x)=k, \quad k\in R(f)$$
the **level sets** of $f$.
