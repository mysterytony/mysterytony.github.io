# Module 3: Theories of Social Order

The very idea of human society presupposes social order. The existence of social order, however, is problematic and cannot be taken for granted. The major theoretical perspectives that have been used to explain the relationship between law and society can be characterized as follows: (a) value consensus; (b) pluralistic or interests theory; and (c) conflict or coercion model of social order. Each reflects different political philosophies, which can be viewed along a continuum moving from conservative, to liberal, to radical.

| (Value Consensus) | (Interests) | (Coercion) |
|---|---|---|
| Consensus | Pluralistic | Conflict |
| Conservative | Liberal | Radical |

## Consensus Model

The consensus model of law and social order is based on the assumption that society is held together by a system of common values. Common values gives legitimacy to government and transforms power into authority. Value consensus foster respect for the law and our social institutions such as the police. The most common application of this model is as a justification for laws and law enforcement. Democratic society and legal systems are based on the assumption that laws and their enforcement represent what "the people want". Laws reflect the collective will.

The basic principles of a consensus model are:

1. Social order is based on consensus and people are committed to a unifying set of values. Values are internalized through socialization and give rise to social order as people conform to norms, customs, and traditions.

2. People obtain personal satisfaction and status from conforming to society's norms and values.

3. Law reflects the collective will of the people. Members of a society agree upon the basic definitions of right and wrong and the law is merely the written statement of this collective agreement.

4. The law serves all people equally. Because it reflects the collective will of the people, the law neither serves nor represses the interests of any particular group of individuals.

5. The theory explains disorder in reference to improper socialization -- some people are not properly socialized and committed to societal values. From this perspective, crime results from the unique properties of the criminal and solutions for the crime problem, therefore, must focus on the criminal rather than on changing society.

## The Pluralistic Model -- Interests Theory of Social Order

A pluralistic model recognizes the existence of a multiplicity of social groups, which have at times different and competing interests and values. In a complex society, there are competing value systems that give rise to deviant conduct, dissension, alternative lifestyles, protests, crime, etc. People do not necessarily agree upon definitions of right or wrong but they can agree upon a conflict resolution mechanism for resolving disputes. Indeed, it is because we cannot agree on right and wrong that we need dispute resolution mechanisms. The legal system is a mechanism used to resolve disputes in our society without seriously damaging the social fabric.

Social order evolves because people find that they can only achieve their aims nd interests by cooperating with others. Business and commerce, for instance, need dependability and predictability to prosper and thus aim for cooperation and exchange. The result is a mechanism that regulates potential conflict and gives rise to social order.

While society is made up of various interests groups with divergent goals and values, it is in everyone's interests to main a political framework that permits these conflicts to be resolved through peaceful bargaining. People can dissent through the political process by the use of persuasion, protest, voting, lobbying, etc., as long as they follow the law.

According to this perspective, conflict exists over substantive issues but there is consensus over the need to settle differences in a peaceful manner through respect for the law and legal process.

The basic principles of a pluralist model are:

1. Society is composed of diverse social groups. This diversity results from the presence of regional, economic, gender, age, race and ethnic variations in the population.

2. There exist among these groups differing and sometimes conflicting definitions of right and wrong. The various groups have different values, goals, and interests, and at times these will come into conflict with one another.

3. There is a collective agreement on the mechanisms for dispute resolution. All groups agree upon the establishment of a legal and political system within which these conflicts can be peacefully settled. It is in everyone's interest to conform to norms, values, and laws.

4. The legal system is value-neutral and exists as a value-free framework or arena in which disputes can be settled fairly and peacefully.

5. The legal system is concerned with the best interests of society. While it stands above the specific value-laden disputes between individual social groups, the legal system's overriding concern is with the general well being of the society as a whole. It contributes to this well being by providing a peaceful forum for the settlement of conflict.

## The Conflict Model -- Coercion Theory

According to the conflict perspective, social order is the result of power and coercion. Society is characterizes by dissension, conflict, and hostility and people are compelled to conform to laws because of threats and coercion.

This theory explains conflict and disorder in reference to the competition for power ans scarce resources. Those in power eventually impose their will through laws and law enforcement on those who are less powerful. Change in society results from successful struggles for power by certain groups who then impose their will on others. Society is thus characterized by class conflict because the powerful monopolize society's wealth.

Conflict theorists reject the assumption that societies are based upon a shared consensus about important norms and values. Instead, they assume that the most noteworthy feature of any complex society is the presence of conflict between competing groups who differ from each other in terms of wealth and social power.

the conflict perspective emphasizes the coercive and repressive nature of the legal system. The legal system is not an impartial tool for dispute settlement but rather it is a mechanism used by those with political and economic power to advance their own interests.

At any given time, law reflects neither consensus about values nor a mutually agreed upon mechanism for the settlement of disputes. It represents the interests of those with the power to make and enforce the law.

The basic principles of a conflict perspective are:

1. Society is composed of diverse groups who compete for scarce resources.
2. there exist differing definitions of right and wrong. Social groups have diverse values, goals, and interests and at times these conflict with one another.
3. The conflict between social groups is one of political power. At all times there is an imbalance of political power, with those who have it struggling to maintain it, and those who do not have it struggling to obtain it.
4. Law is designed to advance the interests of those in power. The law is not a value-neutral forum for dispute settlement. It is a mechanism for those with the power to make the law to advance their own interests, without particular concern for the overall good of the society. The law serves specific groups and is not designed to serve the interests of society as a whole.
5. A key interest of those in power is to prevent change and maintain the status quo. Power is maintained by defining as criminal those behaviors, which conflict with their interests. Totalitarian societies rely heavily on a coercive system of social controls.

The key factor in determining political power in the conflict perspective is class structure. Law results from the ability of more powerful members of society to impose their will upon those who are less powerful. The ruling class controls the political system and has the power to make illegal any behavior that threatens its own interests. Instead of arising from consensus and providing justice for all, the law is in reality a weapon of oppression and the police are servants of the ruling elite.

The conflict model provides the following theoretical perspective on crime, law, and social control.

As a theory of **crime**, the conflict perspective argues that capitalistic society benefits an elite class and is structured in such a way that a huge underclass is deprived of material wealth. In other words, people in the lower classes are driven to lawbreaking by economic oppression.

As a theory of **law**, conflict models argue that laws are not based on consensus but on the power of the ruling classes. Law serves the interests of the elite and legitimizes the rights of powerful interest groups.

As a theory of theory of **social control**, conflict theories argue that law and the machinery of criminal justice (the police, courts, etc.) are used to maintain the status quo and punish those who threaten the well being of the elite. The police are the repressive arm of a repressive government.

## Thorsten Sellin -- Culture Conflict Theory (1938)

Thorsten Sellin's theory of culture conflict argues that crime originates from expectations brought to bear on individuals by subcultural and/or ethnic values that are in conflict with society's laws. Laws reflect the values of the dominant group but do not respect the cultural traditions of smaller ethnic communities. According to Sellin's culture conflict theory, people commit deviant acts because they live in a culture or subculture in which the norms are in conflict with the larger society. Culture conflict develops:

1. Where these codes clash on the border of contiguous culture areas.
2. When the law of one cultural group is extended to cover the territory of another (e.g., Canadian criminal law covers aboriginal nations).
3. When members of one cultural group migrate to another culture. The theory is criticized as deterministic because it fails to consider free will and volition.

From the perspective of the subculture (or ethnic group), the individual is conforming but from the perspective of the larger society, he/she is deviant.

The theory is criticized because it fails to explain most serious crime since no cultural group positively approves behavior such as rape, robbery, or murder.

## Critique

Critics of the consensus model argue that modern societies are not homogeneous and that it is difficult to define a system of values upon which most people agree. Consensus theorists argue, however, that there are sufficient core values to form the basis of social order (e.g., democracy, freedom of speech and the press, due process, equality, hard work, rationality, etc.). In addition, there is consensus with respect to the means by which conflict is to be settled -- non-violently and through the use of our legal system. Value consensus represents a necessary condition but is insufficient in itself to fully explain social order.

The interest's theory argues that people conform because it is in their interests to do so and because they receive benefits from social order. Critics argue that interests are not freely chosen, as the theory suggests, and that society imposes goals and interests on individual members. Nonetheless, the fact that people adjust their interests to each other for mutual benefit is widely recognized as a necessary but not a sufficient condition for social order.

Critics of conflict theory argue that coercion in seldom a sufficient condition to main social order. The use of coercion means that people will resist and will constantly have to be watched and controlled. Although some coercion is necessary to maintain social order, societies that rely on coercion exclusively will be unstable in the long run.

While it is possible to conceptualize these perspectives as separate categories or ideal types, in practice political theorists typically combine parts of each perspective in their models of society. Most theorists argue that social order depends upon a combination of coercion, interests, and value consensus. The extent to which one has priority over the others varies from culture to culture and is an empirical question and changes over time.
