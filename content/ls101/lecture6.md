# Module 6: Civil Litigation and Tort Law

## Civil Litigation and the Trial Process

The vast majority of civil cases (beyond small claims court -- lawsuits involving less than $10,000 in Ontario) do not make it to the trial. Civil actions are so time consuming and costly that most plaintiffs cannot afford them and most cases are not worth the expense.

In addition, the system is set up to screen out cases and to discourage them from going forward by helping or forcing plaintiffs and defendants to settle. Some provinces such as Ontario have instituted a mandatory mediation process before the case can proceed to  determine whether or not there is a possibility of settling the dispute rather than to take it to the trial.

## Steps in the Civil Litigation Process -- Superior Court Level

One objective in the early stages of civil litigation is to uncover as much information as possible before the case comes to trial. This means that the factual and legal issues must be identified and both sides are fully informed and prepared in advance of the trial.

The process is governed and regulated by procedural law that outlines the various steps that each side must take before moving to the next stage of the process. Most civil cases require the services of a lawyer who has familiarity with the legal procedures and knows how to fill in the required paperwork and make the appropriate motions.

## Pre-Trial Procedures

In Ontario, an action is started by filing a notice of action (some provinces have a Writ of Summons) that informs the defendant that an action has been started.

The notice is filled out by the plaintiff and taken to a court registry where a fee is paid and the seal of the court is affixed to make it an official court document. The plaintiff must serve the warrant to the defendant in person (or to the corporation office).

The defendant is given a specified time period to respond to the action or the plaintiff can go to court to seek a default judgement.

The plaintiff must make a statement of claim that outlines his/her allegations and damages and includes supporting documents (this is referred to as the pleadings). This is an official notices to the other party and the defendant must respond to this statement of claim. This statement of claim does not have all of the facts but is more or less a broad statement of the alleged harm caused by the defendant.

The defendant prepares a statement of defence and files it with the court registry and serves a copy of the plaintiff. Often, the defendant will make a counter-claim against the plaintiff in this document. The plaintiff will now have to respond to this counter-claim.

Lawyers are typically involved and may request further information from either party. Lawyers may also engage in pre-trail motions to dismiss the proceedings, ask for a change of venue, etc.

## Discovery

The discovery takes place in the pre-trail phase and involves an examination of documents by the lawyers -- typically in each other's office.

It also may involve the testimony and questioning under oath of both parties by both lawyers.

The objective is to make available all of the evidence and allegations before the trial begins and to ensure that there are no surprises later in the court.

These proceedings are transcribed by a court reporter and become part of the evidence at trial. The questions are detailed and specific although lawyers can object to certain lines of questioning if they are not relevant to the issue. Generally, lawyers allow each other broad leeway in cross-examinations of their clients.

## In-Chamber Meetings

It is common in many jurisdictions for lawyers to meet with a judge who does not try the case and explain why a settlement cannot be reached. Judges will question the merits of the case, point out weaknesses, and pressure both sides to come to an agreement.

Judges may require a payment to the court by one or both parties to cover the costs of the other parties' lawyer's fees. This is used to discourage people from proceeding and to settle.

Defendants can also make payments to the court if they admit to lesser damages than claimed by the plaintiff. If the judge rules that the damages are what the defendant has greed to pay, he/she may award costs to the defendant.

## The Trial

The trial is similar to criminal trials with both the plaintiff and defendant testifying under oath and being questioned and cross-examined. Civil cases are heard by judge only unless it's a personal injury case and then a jury can hear the case. There are strict rules of evidence followed (e.g., your lawyer may not use leading questions but the lawyer doing the cross-examination can do so). Hearsay evidence is not admissible.

Finally, the judge makes a determination based on the balance of probabilities and usually sums up his/her argument in writing and releases the judgement a few days or weeks later.

The judge may award special damages (for specific accountable costs); generally damages for those that cannot be clearly specified such as pain and suffering and future loss of income or business; punitive damages as a form of deterrence and denunciation; costs including lawyer's fees; an injunction ordering someone to cease and desist; or a requirement for specific performance of certain obligations such as may be set out in a contract.

## Small Claims Court

The small claims court hears cases in which the damages contested are below $10,000 (soon to be $25,000 in Ontario). The plaintiff initiates the action by filing a document stating the nature of the complaint; the document is served on the defendant; the defendant responds; and a court appearance date is scheduled. Lawyers are not usually present since the amount contested and the legal costs awarded are relatively small.

The judge takes a more active role questioning and cross-examining witnesses. Judgement is typically made on the spot.

## Appeals

Appeals can be made based on questions of law but not based on questions of fact. If an error in law has occurred, then an appeal may be granted. The costs of appeals are prohibitive since transcripts along can run into thousands of dollars.

The appellant launches the appeal and the respondent replies to the action.

Appeals can be turned away and not heard. If heard, the appeal court may uphold the decision; order a new trial; or overturn the decision.

## Enforcement

The process of recovery requires that the victor take steps to get his/her money. This may be difficult if the defendant is broke, bankrupt, or has other creditors also fighting for the remaining funds. The cost of bringing an action may not be worth the reward if the defendant avoids payment.

If the person has money or assets, then the victor can take steps to garnishee wages or bank accounts. Only a portion of a debtor's wages can be seized since the law requires that they be left with enough to live.

## BASIC PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING TORT LAW

Tort law deals with situations in which one party has caused harm or injury to another party or their property. In law, torts refer to a breach of legal duty with liability for damages. Torts are used in the absence of a contract. A tort action is an attempt to use the civil law to bring a private action to seek compensation for the injuries suffered. Torts are attempts to compensate for private wrongs. Tort liability is premised on a lesser degree of proof, i.e., a **balance of probabilities**.

Some behaviors are governed by statutes that do not require the plaintiff to prove that the defendant was at fault. Simply committing the act makes the person guilty. There are known as offences of **strict liability**. **Vicarious Liability** involves situations in which a person is held responsible for the actions of others. Examples include people in your employ or under your command. **Joint Liability** refers to situations in which several people are held as jointly responsible for the harm committed. Partners in business are generally responsible for each other's wrongdoings.

## Court Judgements -- Remedies

If a defendant is found by the court to be responsible for the plaintiff's injury, the victim can receive damages. Damages consist of a financial award or compensation to redress the hard or loss suffered by the plaintiff. Special damages can be calculated precisely (the cost of repairing a car) whereas general damages are awarded when it is difficult to precisely determine loss or injury. Pain and suffering is often determined by a schedule that has been worked out by insurance agencies and lawyers. Punitive or exemplary damages are rare in Canada and are meant to punish defendants and to make an example of them. The indention is to deter the defendant and others from similar actions in the future.

Other judgements include an **injunction** in which the court orders that the defendant cease his/her wrongful conduct (e.g., harassing phone calls). The judge can also order the defendant to return goods to their rightful owner (*replevin*).

**Intentional** torts refer to actions that are wilful, deliberate, and conscious. The person need only intend the act and not the harm that results for them to be liable (e.g. push someone and they break an arm). **Negligence** refers to actions that are inadvertent rather than wilful or deliberate. The overwhelming number of actions in civil court deal with negligence.

There are five elements that must be present for a negligence suit to be successful.

1. The first test is referred to as **duty of care** and the court must decide whether or not there was a duty on the part of the defendant to be careful or whether no such obligation existed.
2. The court also determines whether or not the defendant's behavior fell below that standard and constitutes **fault** (or **breach**). Torts include acts or omissions that are willful or intentional as well as inadvertent or careless. The test used to determine if a person has maintained an appropriate duty of care is whether or not the harm was **reasonably foreseeable**.
3. **Loss, damage, or injury** must be present for liability for negligence to be imposed. The plaintiff must demonstrate that he/she suffered some sort of loss or injury. Today the courts recognize mental distress as well as physical injury in negligence cases.
4. **Causation** must also be established to show that the damage or injury was directly caused by the conduct of the defendant. There must be a sufficiently close causal connection between the action and the injury.
5. There must also be no prejudicial conduct (**contributory negligence**) on the part of the victim.

**Premises Liability**: The law generally requires that people who own/or occupy property take due care to ensure that no one suffers injury or harm when on that property. Schools must put up barriers or signs if the follows have been recently washed and are slippery. Stairs must have guardrails. There must be an operating fire alarm adequate fencing to ensure that children don't wander in and drown.

## Defences to Torts

There are a number of defences to torts: accident, due care, lack of causal connection, no injury to the plaintiff, and prejudicial conduct of the victim. Other defences include necessity, lawful authority, self-defence and defence of property, consent of the victim, and the victim voluntarily assumes the risk. In the case of defamation, one can use the truth and fair comment as a defence.

**Accident**: This is the argument that the defendant could not reasonably foresee the danger, hand no control over the incident, and could not have avoided it with the greatest of care and skill.

**Necessity** refers to self-preservation or the preservation of others. A person may trespass on another's property in order to avoid a physical threat.

Police have **lawful authority** to use force in making an arrest and can use this as a defence to an assault.

**Self defence or defence of property** can be used in both criminal and civil cases for charges of assault.

**Consent as a Defence**: The courts and legislation generally exempt liability when the victim consents to the actions of the defendant such as in a boxing match.

Victims may be disqualified from seeking damages if they **voluntarily assume the risk**. Courts are reluctant to use this against a victim unless he/she also gives up any claim to damages (e.g., if you accompany a person in a stolen car for a joy ride and get injured, you may still sue the driver unless you actively encouraged him/her to drive dangerously or fail to complain about his/her driving).

## The Law in Practice

**Insurance** is often a variable in court decision as is the ability to pay. As the text states, there is always a temptation to place the obligation to pay for damages to the victims on the party who can pay or who has insurance coverage. Part of the reason for this is that the victim may deserve compensation and insurance is meant to spread out the risks and the loss rather than to determine who is at fault.
