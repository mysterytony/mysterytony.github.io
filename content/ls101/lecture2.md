# Module 2: Legal Ethics and the Legal Profession

## Becoming a Lawyer

All Canadian provinces have a governing body (e.g., the Law Society of Upper Canada in Ontario) that is controlled by lawyers and has a monopoly over the certification and discipline of the legal profession. All provincial Bar Associations belong to the Canadian Bar Association (CBA) which produces the CBA Code of Professional Conduct (the Rules).

In order to become a lawyer, applicant must:

1. possess a law degree from an accredited law school;
2. they must work with a law firm under an apprenticeship known as articling;
3. they must pass their bar admission exams

The law degree is an undergraduate degree (a Bachelor in Law) but typically requires completion of a first degree for admission to law school (This is true for Canada but no the UK or Australia).

Articling is largely an unstructured affair in which students learn from more experienced lawyers in order to find out what it's like to work under the pressure of deadlines. This varies from province to province but typically lasts no more than a year.

You must study for and pass your bar entrance exams put on by the provincial bar association and then you are admitted to the bar.

During the bar admission ceremony, graduates take an oath to uphold the highest standards of moral integrity.

This dates back to Rome's *Theodesian Code* and also to Anglo-Saxon England where lawyers have always been required to take an oath to fulfill their professional responsibilities in a good and virtuous manner.

Before even being admitted to the legal profession, applicants must also be certified as being "of good character". You can be refused admission to the bar if you are deemed to be of low character. However, there is little consensus on what the requirement of moral character entails or demands. It is generally thought to include traits such as honesty, integrity and reliability.

Provincial Bar Associations seldom use this provision to deny applicants admission to the bar. Even in cases in which they do, the standards are not clear nor consistent.

In general, applicants are presumed to be of good character and suitable for legal practice unless there is evidence to the contrary.

Law schools and bar Associations do not do in-depth background checks. They make only a brief inquiry into an applicant's moral character and this is largely confined to questions asked on their application forms and relies on the applicant being truthful.

It is relatively rare for the Bar Association to disbar lawyers. Most disciplinary proceedings focus on "professional misconduct" and lead to sanctions much less severe than disbarment.

## Public Perception of Lawyers -- Ambivalence

Public perception is not everything but it is vitally important. The legal profession is as much admired as it is reviled.

The public have a love-hate relationship with lawyers. As a group, lawyers ten to be the butt of much criticism but lawyers are also championed by those who have benefited from their services.

The law profession has an image as a noble and honorable vocation -- defenders of the poor and dispossessed (e.g., See the movie *To Kill a Mockingbird* in which Gregory Peck defends a black man falsely accused of rape).

Lawyers are also viewed with disgust and contempt by many. The negative image revolves around what is perceived to be the unethical conduct of lawyers.

The practice of law places lawyers in ethical dilemmas on an everyday basis.

In addition, lawyers are often tainted by the people they defend -- criminals who have committed serious and disreputable crimes.

Lawyers are also over-represented in positions of power and are frequently at the center of corruption and other scandals.

## The Legal Monopoly

In all provinces, there is a statutory framework that prohibits unauthorized persons from engaging in the practice of law.

This prohibition is intended to ensure that clients can be confident that the person they consult has received appropriate training and is answerable to the Law Association.

Although this is intended to protect the public, it also permits the legal profession to maintain its monopoly over the provision of legal services.

Recently, the Law Society of Upper Canada has gained the legal authority to set standards for paralegals and for their accreditation.

## The Canadian Bar Association's Code of Professional Conduct

The code is used to impose a set of ethical standards that lawyers must follow in the practice of law.

Lawyers are viewed as protectors of the public trust and it is important that they act ethically and be of good moral character.

Members of the law profession are key players in the administration of justice and must not do things that undermine public trust in our system of justice. People will not resort to the justice system if they lose confidence in the system.

Compliance with the rules is not an option. It is demanded by the profession and is used as the basis for disciplining and sanctioning its members.

The Code establishes specific behaviors and expectations for lawyers and it is a mix of prohibitive language: "Thou shalt not" and exhortations: "You are encouraged to".

The Code is supposed to benefit both the public and the profession but critics argue that such codes are little more than ethical window-dressing and serve mainly to legitimate that lawyers do.

Generally, the Rule focus on three aspects of a lawyer's role:

1. As a representative of clients

Once lawyers have taken on clients and decided to act as their representatives, they assume a set of special obligations to those persons or organizations.

They must advise their clients about their legal rights and responsibilities, the possible courses of action, and the likely consequences.

They must advocate their clients' position and defend their interests in a vigorous and competent manner.

They must negotiate on their clients' behalf so as to obtain the best possible result.

And they must pursue litigation when appropriate and in a prompt and diligent way.

2. As an officer of the legal system

Lawyers must act within the law and show respect for the legal system and to all the players including judges, juries, clients, witnesses, and other lawyers.

They must make use of legal procedures in a legitimate and non-abusive way.

And they must act at all times in a way that does not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

3. As a public citizen

These responsibilities are quite vague. Lawyers must seek to ensure that access to the law is made available to as many people as possible, especially the poor and disadvantaged;

They must contribute to the reform and improvement of the legal process;

And they must support efforts to ensure that the legal profession fulfills its civic and public duties.

The Rules are best seen as a rudimentary framework within which lawyers can debate and develop an ethical practice of law.

The main problem with the rules is that they are quite vague and can be interpreted in many ways and may even direct lawyers to act in contradictory ways.

## The Traditional Role of Lawyers -- The Advocate as a Hired Hand

The predominant image of lawyers is that of a professional person who is hired by a client to represent his/her interests.

This "hired hand" image can also be viewed as a theoretical model that guides and justifies what they do and gives lawyers a particular identity.

Cynic have caricatured lawyers as "hired guns" rather than hired hands because they engage in all kinds of vicious battles on behalf of their clients.

The hired hand image is the operating model on which lawyers are trained, under which they function, and is sanctioned by the provincial law societies in their codes of conduct.

This is the traditional image of lawyering and is based on the idea that lawyers are professionals who have acquired specialized knowledge and expertise, which they use on behalf of their clients.

Lawyers see themselves as neutral when it comes to the issues or the law. They will take either side in a dispute and they accept and make use of the law as given.

From this perspective, all clients are citizens who have been victimized and who seek relief and/or vindication.

## The Adversarial System

This traditional view of law has its roots in the adversarial system. The adversary model is the basis of our justice system and involves lawyers doing battle in the courts on behalf of their clients.

The adversary system has its historical origins in trails by ordeal and by battle. Historically, adversaries (or their champions) would compete in a physical contest in the belief that good would triumph over evil and that justice would be served.

There are several characteristics of the adversary system:

1. An aggrieved party initiates the proceedings
2. Both sides may have legal representation
3. Lawyers act on behalf of their clients' best interests
4. Lawyers do battle in court by presenting evidence, making arguments and through cross-examination
5. The judge and/or jury are neutral observers and adjudicators
6. There is a winner and a loser

The rationale for the use of an adversarial system of justice includes several arguments:

1. It facilitates the pursuit and discovery of the truth
2. It protects basic rights and freedoms
3. And it satisfies litigants by giving them their day in court

Critics of the adversarial system argue that:

1. It obscures rather than illuminates truth
2. It foster injustice by allowing the strong or the rich to triumph over the weak and the poor
3. It undermines respect for the judicial system when injustices result and fosters bitterness and cynicism among the public.

It is very costly to use the courts and because of that the system favors the rich over the poor. A client's wealth can have a strong impact on the outcome of legal proceedings.

This means that injustices will result and bring the justice system into disrepute.

Critics argue that many lawyers are unconcerned about justice and are more than willing to sell themselves and their consciences to the highest bidder.

Some critics argue that certain lawyers and law firms consistently defend bad causes and act in an immoral manner. Firms that make millions defending tobacco companies are often condemned for their cause and the tactics used. Lawyers are also criticized because they represent the powerful and thus help keep the poor and minorities poor, subjugated, and powerless.

Tax lawyers are also criticized because they earn a lot of money by advising rich clients on how to get around tax laws.

## Ethical Norms when Dealing With Clients

### Obligations to Clients

Lawyers assume a wide variety of obligations to clients. These include: (1) partisanship, (2) competence, (3) loyalty, (4) candour, (5) pro-action, and (6) confidentiality.

1. Partisanship

In legal terms, the lawyers acts in a fiduciary capacity in relation to client interests.

Because there is an imbalance of power between lawyers and clients, clients have a right to receive a higher standard of attention than other service contracts.

The power imbalance imposes special and exclusive duties on lawyers to act with good faith and loyalty to the client.

Some commentators believe that lawyers have an exclusive obligation to put their client's interest above and beyond those of everyone else and at almost any cost to anyone else.

The Law Society Code prohibits harming third parties and there is an ongoing debate over when the duty of zealous partisanship should give way to the public interest.

2. Competence

Code of professional conduct also require lawyers to be competent and to deliver services "in a conscientious, diligent, and efficient manner".

The standard demanded of lawyers is that expected of "a competent lawyer in a like situation."

Lawyers should only accept cases in their area of expertise and to be up front with their clients about their lack of knowledge and experience in other areas.

It is extremely rare for lawyers to be disciplined for lack of competence. Law Societies are reactive and put little effort in monitoring the competence of lawyers on any regular or serious basis.

It is more common -- but still infrequent  -- for lawyers to be brought to task for disgraceful or dishonorable conduct.

3. Loyalty and Conflicts of Interest

Lawyers must be loyal to their clients and place their client's interests above all else.

Lawyers are prohibited from engaging in conduct that jeopardizes the clients' interests.

They must complete disclosure to clients about conflicting interests that exists or are likely to arise. These include personal or family interests and those of associates.

4. Candour

It is incumbent on lawyers to deal with their clients in an entirely open and honest way. They must provide candid advice and guidance to clients on all legal and professional matters including the merits of the case and the probable outcomes.

5. Pro-activity

It is the lawyer's duty to actively pursue their clients' interests.

They must be pro-active rather than reactive and should pursue their clients' case vigorously even if it involves asking certain distasteful (but necessary) questions.

The Law Society Code cautions lawyers not to let their zeal get the better of them and engage in disreputable practices. Lawyers must represent their clients by fair and honorable means.

They also have a duty to treat the court with respect and courtesy. It is inappropriate to engage in tactics or initiatives that will taint the overall process of the court. Lawyers should not engage in frivolous behavior that will delay proceedings or harass the other side.

Lawyers should not facilitate their clients efforts to deliberately harm another's interests especially if such actions would not improve the situation of their clients.

6. Confidentiality -- The Lawyer-Client Privilege

### The Evidentiary Privilege

Lawyers have a clear and demanding obligation to "**hold in strict confidence**" all information that comes intro their possession while fulfilling their professional duties toward clients.

This duty aries both from the lawyer's contract with the client and the duty placed on lawyers by law and by professional codes.

Confidentiality covers all communications between clients and themselves and lawyers are relieved of this duty only through the client's waiver or the courts' order.

Lawyers cannot divulge information to others nor can they use such information for their own benefit -- even if it will have no detrimental effect on their clients' interests.

Under evidentiary rules, lawyers are entitled and required to keep confidential all communications between clients and themselves that pertain to the giving of legal advice.

Under the law of evidence, communications between lawyers and their clients are privileged and impose on lawyers a duty not to reveal them or use them in any way to the clients' disadvantage.

### The Paul Bernardo Case

Paul Bernardo's first lawyer, Ken Murray, was charged with obstructing justice for removing six videotapes from Bernardo and Karla Homolka's house. The tapes had been hidden in the ceiling of the home and Murray learned about them through Bernardo. The police failed to find them in a 71 day search of the home during which they dismantled the interior.

From his jail cell, Bernardo wrote his lawyer asking him to attend to his house after the police had finished their search and retrieve the tapes. Murray did so in the company of an associate Carolyn MacDonald and a law clerk.

A pact was made at Murray's suggestion that they would not reveal to anyone what they had found. The tapes were later viewed by both Murray and MacDonald and then kept in a safe in his office for 17 months.

The tapes depicted the rapes of two teenage girls and the rapes and torture of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French whom Bernardo later killed.

Murray later asked another lawyer, John Rosen, to defend Bernardo at trail but did not immediately inform Rosen of the existence of the tapes.

Murray handed the tapes to Rosen only 17 months after taking them from the house and a month after Rosen had taken over the case. The change in lawyers led to an additional one year delay in the trial.

Rosen handed the tapes over to authorities but it was too late to undo the infamous deal the Crown had already made with Karla Homolka who was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter and receive a sentence of 12 years in prison in exchange for testifying against Bernardo.

Rosen later testified that when he aw the tapes, he felt an ethical obligation to give them to the police. He stated that he was stunned by what he saw and that the tapes showed clearly that Bernardo was guilty of abduction, unlawful confinement, and aggravated sexual assault on French and Mahaffy. The tapes also showed Homolka taking part in the rapes and torture of the two victims.

The judge in Bernardo's murder trail described the rapes as undescribably horrible. They revealed the two murder victims being forced to participate with Bernardo and Homolka in the grossest sexual perversions. In the course of the sexual assaults they are forced to pretend to be enjoying the experience through scripted dialogue and to smile at the camera. Obedience is obtained through physical assault and Bernardo threatening each of them with death if they do not perform as directed.

Before he handed them over to authorities, Rossen tried to use them as leverage to plea-bargain for a reduced charge of second-degree murder against Bernardo and a chance of parole after 15 years. He told prosecutors that a first-degree murder trial would be "dreadful" and "devastating" to the victims' families and "humiliating to the memory of their children." He said that prosecutors had a good idea of what evidence had been passed on to him by Murray and he warned them "if a picture is worth a thousand words then start multiplying it."

Bernardo was convicted of both murders and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years.

### Murray's Trail for Obstructing Justice

In his trial for obstructing justice, Murray pleaded solicitor-client privilege. He claimed that he had to wait before turning over the tapes because of a confidential client-solicitor arrangement with Bernardo.

Murray's lawyer argued that clients have a right to attorney loyalty and confidentiality and that Murray was under no legal obligation to hand over the tapes to the police.

At Murray's trial, the judge rejected the contention that solicitor-client privilege allowed Murray to maintain possession of the videotapes. The tapes were dramatic evidence of a crime and pre-existed before the solicitor-client relationship.

While the discussions Murray may have had with Bernardo may been privileged, the tapes themselves were not. The judge ruled that Murray could not use the lawyer-client privilege to defend his actions. Murray was a party to concealing evidence and obstructing justice.

The judge stated that once Murray had viewed tha tapes and learned of their evidentiary value, he had three legal options:

1. Immediately turn over the tapes to the prosecution
2. Deposit them with the trial judge
3. Disclose their existence to the prosecution and prepare to do battle to retain them

The judge found that by retaining the tapes, Murray had in fact obstructed justice. The question remained of intent or mens rea.

Ultimately, the judge accepted the defence's contention that Murray retained the tapes so that he could use them in his client's defence. The judge accepted this defence even though he found it difficult to conceive how the tapes could possible be used to defend Bernardo.

The judge acknowledged that the Law Society of Upper Canada had few guidelines for someone in Murray's position and that even by consulting others, Murray could have been confused over the proper course of action.

The judge reluctantly accepted Murray's contention that he believed that under the circumstances, he had no legal duty to disclose tha tapes until trail and acquitted him of obstruction.

The Law Society of Upper Canada also charged Murray with professional misconduct. Later they withdrew the charge stating that the "The Professional Regulation Committee concluded that the public interest would be better served by clarification of lawyers' professional responsibilities when confronted with such a dilemma than by the continuation of misconduct proceedings against Mr. Murray."

The Committee concluded that the rules were too vague and recommended that a committee be set up to report on issues raised in the case.

### The Role of the Crown Attorney

A Crown Attorney is a representative of the government and is trusted with ensuring that due process occurs. He/she must not proceed with a charge unless there is a "substantial likelihood of conviction."

The Crown decides whether to continue with charges, when to drop them, in what circumstances to accept a plea bargain, what tactics to use at trial, and whether to stay proceedings.

The Crown represents the public's interests and must be fair and impartial. The duty of prosecutors is not to seek convictions, but to seek the truth and ensure that the accused has a fair trail.

Unlike defence counsel, they can only pursue a line of argument they have good reason be believe to be true.

The duty of prosecutors is to present all credible and relevant evidence to the court so "that justice may be done through a fair trail."

The Crown must disclose all relevant evidence as early as possible.

### Critiques of the Legal Profession from a Conflict Perspective

The argument that lawyers treat all clients the same is scoffed at by conflict theorists.

The practice of law is a business and lawyers prefer clients with money.

The poor are often under-represented and overwhelmed in legal cases.

Lawyers make the situation of poorer people worse by representing the interests of the rich.

The types of life problems faced by the poor differ from the problems faced by the more privileged classes.

The lives of the rich are relatively problem free and problems are not systemic. Instead, the privileged classed will face problems only sporadically and will use the legal profession to deal with these occasional bumps in their otherwise smooth life.

The problems faced by the poor in contrast are numerous, continuous, and systemic.

Social, economic and legal problems constitute and define much of their life.

Whereas advantaged clients want their lawyers to use the system to remedy a discrete conflict, poor people want lawyers to change the system so they can escape life's continual round of legal difficulties and bureaucratic hassles.

The practice of law from this perspective is not a neutral exercise. One group wants change the other resists change.

Conflict theorists argue that lawyers are the enlisted custodian of the statue quo.

By pretending otherwise and renouncing responsibility for the system that their actions hold in place, lawyers are able to maintain a false image of themselves as independent and impartial.

Critics further suggest that the practice of law not only prevents meaningful social change that would benefit the poor, it also:

1. Wastes energy and undermines efficiency
2. Fails to involve citizens as democratic participants in the process of change
