# Module 11: The Legislation of Morality -- Drug Legislation and Social Policy in Canada

## The History of Drug Legislation in Canada

In 1908, the Canadian Federal Government passed its first drug laws with the proclamation of the Opium Act, which prohibits the importation, manufacture, and sale of opium. Further criminal legislation followed in 1911 in the form of The Opium and Drug Act. Prior to the enactment of this legislation, the Chinese community on the West Coast of Canada lawfully imported large quantities of opium for their own consumption; drug use caused little concern amongst the population; and opiates were widely available in a variety of legal medicines.

Up to the 1880s, Canadian immigration policy encouraged the importation of cheap labour and Chinese workers earned low wages in British Columbia's mining sector and in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Chinese were well accepted and generally praised by employers who viewed them as hard working, conscientious, thrifty, and law-abiding. By 1885, the railway was complete and the mining boom tapered off and B.C. experienced an economic downturn. These events created a restricted and competitive labour market resulting in Chinese workers competing directly with whites for jobs. In response to the mounting "Asian problem", the Canadian government passed the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 restricting Chinese immigration, denying Chinese the right to vote, placing restrictions on their ownership of land and businesses, and imposing on them an annual immigrant tax.

When racial unrest in British Columbia resulted in the 1907 Vancouver riots, the federal government dispatched the Deputy Minister of Labour and future Prime Minister of Canada, William Lyon MacKenzie King, to investigate the damage done to Asian businesses. King received claims for compensation from Chinese opium-manufacturing merchants whose stock had been destroyed in the riot and was surprised to discover the existence of a large opium industry. Not only were tons of opiates imported into Canada and consumed by the Chinese each year, but various opium preparations were freely distributed by doctors, travelling medicine shows, patent medicine companies, pharmacies, and sold in general stores.

MacKenzie King undertook a second unofficial investigation of opiate use in his capacity as a concerned citizen and submitted a private report to Parliament. He did not discuss the physiological effects of opium but instead emphasized the drug's deleterious social and moral impact. He viewed opium as a poison, which destroyed the inhibitions of a good Christian upbringing and thus exposed man's natural tendency for depravity.

King argued that as a Christian nation, Canada should set an example in the international campaign against opium. Less than three weeks after King submitted his private study, the Opium Act of 1908 was passed in the House of Commons without discussion or opposition. There is little evidence to indicate that British Columbian citizens at that time were concerned about the use of opium by the Chinese or that a moral stigma was attached to drug use. Rather, drug addiction tended to bew viewed as a medical problem or personal vice and did not seriously violate prevailing moral values. Thus the decision to criminally prohibit non-medical opiate use did not rise primarily from concern over its addictive properties but rather from a re-definition of its moral impact by a small number of moral reformers.

Most historians argue that the 1908 Opium Act was based less on health concerns than on racial and economic factors. The attempt to criminalize opium usage represented a means of social control that targeted the West Coast Chinese community - a segment of the population that was poor, politically powerless, and the object of racial animosity.

Moral entrepreneurs in Canada launched similar crusades against alcohol and tobacco, but failed to persuade the government to take action. By comparison, the campaign against opium changed both the public perception of non-medical drug use and the criminal law. The anti-opium movement was successful because it was directed at the Chinese - a disliked and powerless minority. At the same time, it did not target the large number of Caucasian users dependent on the opium-based products of the Caucasian pharmaceutical companies.

In 1920, Maclean's magazine ran five racially-biased articles on Asians and drug use written by Mrs. Emily Murphy, a Magistrate from Edmonton, Alberta. In her book, the Black Candle (1922), she claimed that drug use was rampant in some sectors of the country and that is was linked to moral turpitude, spiritual depravity, crime, and insanity. The Black Candle led its readers to believe that vile and corrupt Asian and black addicts were spreading addiction among innocent white persons. Presumably in a response to this and other lobbying, Parliament passed the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act of 1923, added cannabis to the list of prohibited substances, and included a provision for the deportation of aliens convicted of certain drug offences.

In 1920, the newly created federal Department of Health was given responsibility for supervising Canada's drug laws and international treaty obligations and soon created a Narcotic Control Division. The RCMP allied itself with the Narcotic Division and served as its enforcement arm. The Division in turn acted as spokesperson for the RCMP and periodically proposed enabling legislation when officers faced enforcement and investigative problems.

From 1930 to 1950, the Canadian government continued to expand both the number of prohibited drugs and the range of drug offences punishable by law. Meanwhile, the police and courts used these powers effectively to process substantial numbers drug offenders. Increasingly severe penalities were the norm for drug laws in the four decades from 1920-1960 and continued in the 1961 Food and Drug Act and Narcotic Control Act. In the latter legislation, the maximum sentence for trafficking, possession for the purpose of trafficking, and for importing/exporting narcotics was raised from 14 years to life imprisonment and a minimum seven year sentence was prescribed for the importing/exporting offence. There was little opposition to punitive drug laws while drug users were viewed as outsiders and were primarily from the lower socioeconomic class, particular ethnic groups, and remained politically powerless.

Opposition to harsh penalties emerged in the 1960s, however, when significant numbers of young middle-class Canadians began using marijuana and hallucinogenic drugs. Convictions for cannabis offences rose markedly during the 1960s and 1970s until marijuana and hashish offences represented ninety percent of all drug convictions and the law was widely criticized for making criminals of otherwise law abiding and respectable youth. Public concern over the drug issue continued throughout the late 1960's fuelled in large part by extensive media coverage. Academics, parents, civil libertarians, and prominent political figures criticized the Narcotic Control Act as being unduly severe and proposed sweeping changes to the law.

The federal government responded to these diverse pressures by appointing a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the non-medical use of drugs. The Le Dain Commission issued four reports in the early 1970s and recommended a harm reduction strategy based on the gradual withdrawal of criminal sanctions for drug usage. Despite the relative positive reception of the Le Dain Commission's findings among many Canadians, the government has largely ignored their recommendations.

The Canadian government made modest changes in 1969, however, when it gave prosecutors the option of proceeding by way of summary conviction in possession cases--a discretion that hand only been withdrawn in 1961. The Narcotic Control Act was amended in 1969 to include a "fine only" sentencing option, and in 1972 to allow judges to impose an absolute or conditional discharge. Such discharges were new to the Criminal Code and resulted in a finding of guilt without a conviction being registered.

The courts in the meantime responded to these changes in law and to changing values by imposing the less severe find and discharge options. Some authors suggest that declines in the severity for cannabis possession during this period helped reduce pressure for meaningful law reform. The 1970s and 1980s also witnessed increasing recognition by the courts and legislatures of individual rights in drug cases. During this period, mandatory sentences for importation were removed, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) was declared, and the infamous writs of assistance were abolished. Although these changes were significant, they were far fewer and less radical than the various legal changes that were advocated and debated during this time period.

In 1986, the American President, Ronald Reagan stepped up the war on drugs. The resurgence of prohibition in the U.S. was influenced by the drug panic over cocaine and crack cocaine. Highly negative images of crack addicts in the U.S. helped manufacture a drug panic and create support for an increasingly harsh legal response. Although this renewed prohibitionist approach was provoked in part by an overly fearful image of the dangers of cocaine, the majority of charges for drug offences in Canada continued to be for cannabis usage (64 percent in 1990).

The history of drug legislation in Canada is a history of repressive laws and relatively zealous law enforcement. Despite some softening in the 1960s and 1970s, drug laws and policies have changed very little in the past four decades. Canada continues to prohibit a vast array of narcotics and relies primarily on repressive measures of law enforcement and sentencing as a mechanism of social control. Unlike the United States, however, Canada did not embrace an all-out drug war and drug policies in this country are less repressive and more ambivalent than the United States.

In 1977, the government of Canada enacted the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to replace the Narcotics Control Act and the Food and Drug Act.

The Le Dain Commission's goal of gradually diminishing criminal sanctions against users and the developing of alternative means to discourage drug use and diminish harm has not been seriously attempted in Canada. Even with respect to marijuana, little change has occurred despite the government's almost annual discussions about the possibility of decriminalizing this drug.

## Canadian Drug Legislation

In Canada, the Controlled Drug and Substances Act (CDSA) outlines prohibited drugs and penalties for possession, manufacturing, importing and trafficking in prohibited substances. Other relevant legislation includes sections in the Criminal Code related to conspiracy, organized crime "anti-gang" provisions, and proceeds of crime/money laundering laws. Additional laws govern police investigative techniques including electronic surveillance, search and seizure, trespassing, the use of agents and informants, disclosure, and entrapment. Many of the laws created by Parliament including recent anti-gang legislation are meant to facilitate police investigations and prosecutions of organized criminal syndicates.

Concern with civil liberties and the potential for abuse have led to constitutional challenges to police practices and a variety of case laws that govern and restrict drug investigations. These legal restrictions are largely unique to drug cases because law enforcement officers are proactive in their pursuit of higher-level drug traffickers.

## The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act

In 1997, Parliament replaced the Narcotic Control Act and the Food and Drug Act with the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to regulate dangerous drug and narcotics. The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act classifies drugs into eight categories or "Schedules" ranging from opiates, cannabis, hallucinogens, and a vast array of prescription drugs. Schedule I includes the most dangerous drugs and narcotics such as heroin and cocaine; Schedule II lists cannabis and its derivatives; Schedule III includes amphetamines and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); and Schedule IV includes drugs such as barbiturates and anabolic steroids that may be dangerous but also have therapeutic uses.

## Sentences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act

Penalties under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act are severe and anyone who is in possession of a controlled substance is guilty of an indictable offence punishable by a maximum of seven years for Schedule I drugs, five years for Schedule II substances, three years for Schedule III drugs, and eighteen months for Schedule IV substances.

Anyone found guilty of importing or exporting, producing, trafficking, conspiracy to traffic in substances included in Schedule I and II is liable to imprisonment for life (C.C. S.5(3) S.6(3), S.7(3)). Schedule I includes heroin and cocaine whereas Schedule II contains marijuana and other cannabis derivatives. Trafficking in Schedule III substances can bring a 10-year sentence and the maximum penalty for Schedule IV substances is there years.

Section 10 of the Act states that the fundamental purpose of any sentence is to contribute to the respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society while encouraging rehabilitation and treatment of offenders, as well as acknowledging the harm done to victims and to the community.

The Act also lists aggravating factors that a judge must consider when imposing a sentence on a person convicted of substances including the use of a weapon, violence or threats of violence, trafficking near schools or other public places frequented by young people, trafficking to persons under the age of 18 years, a previous conviction for a drug offence, and engaging a person under the age of 18 years in the commission of a substance offence.

## Offences

Offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and the Criminal Code of Canada (C.C.C.) include:

1. Possession of a controlled substance (Schedule I, II, III, IV drugs only) (Sec. 4 CDSA).
2. Double-doctoring (Schedule I, II, III, IV, drugs only) (Sec 4.2 CDSA)
3. Possession for the purpose of trafficking (Schedule I, II, III, IV drugs only) (Sec. 4 CDSA).
4. Trafficking in a controlled substance (Schedule I, II, III, IV drugs only) (Sec. 5 CDSA)
5. Importing or exporting a controlled substance (Schedule I, II, III, IV, V, VI) (Sec. 6 CDSA)
6. Production of a substance (Schedule I, II, III, IV drugs only) (Sec 7 CDSA).
7. Possession of property obtained by crime (Sec. 8 CDSA) (Sec 462.31(1) C.C.C.)
8. Laundering the proceeds of crime (Sec. 9 CDSA) (Sec. 462.31(1) C.C.C.)
9. Conspiracy laws (Sec. 465 C.C.C.)
10. Participation in criminal organizations (Sec. 467.(1) C.C.C.)

## 1. Possession

Section 4(3) of the Criminal Code defines possession for the purpose of the law and states:

Section 4(3) For the purpose of this Act,

a. A person has anything in possession when he has it in his personal possession or knowingly

i. Has it in the actual possession or custody of another person, or

ii. Has it in any place, whether or not that place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself or of another person, and

b. Where one of two or more persons, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has anything in his custody or possession, it shall be deemed to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.

Section 4(3) deals with the often-contentious subject of what constitutes possession and is relevant to stolen property and illicit drug cases. Personal possession includes actual possession whereas constructive possession occurs when the accused knowingly has an item in possession of another with some control over that item.

To establish possession, the Crown must prove that the accused has a guilty state of mind (mens rea) and thus had knowledge of the substance in question and of its nature. It is not necessary for the accused to know the exact nature of the drug he/she possesses. So long as the accused believes the drugs in prohibited, or he/she is willfully blind to it being such a drug, then the knowledge necessary ro constitute the offence is established (Beaver v. Regina 1957).

Mens rea is typically proven through an accused person's confession, statement, comments, or inferred from other evidence such as where the drugs were found, fingerprints, police observations of the person handling the drugs, and other items such as his/her possession of scales, pipes, and additional narcotics. Similarly, control is seldom problem by direct evidence but must be inferred from other facts proved in evidence. This often includes the statements of a co-accused and evidence that the person had access to the drugs such as a key to a storage locker or their location in a girlfriend's home.

## 2. Double-doctoring

Under Section 4.2 of the Controlled Drugs and Substance Act, it is an offence to seek to obtain any of the substances from Schedules I to IV from a practitioner, such as a physician, without disclosing particular relating to the acquisition of any of the scheduled substances from any other practitioner within the preceding 30 days. This offence is known as "double-doctoring" or "prescription shopping" and is punishable by imprisonment up to seven years for Schedule I substances, five years for Schedule II drugs, three years for Schedule III substances, and 18 months for Schedule IV substances. The offence of double-doctoring reflects a concern about the abuse of prescription drugs and narcotics, particularly by addicts at times when heroin in scarce.

## 3. and 4. Possession for the Purpose of Trafficking and Trafficking

Trafficking within the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is found under Section 5, which states;

5.(1) No person shall traffic in a substance included in Schedule I, II, III, or IV or in any substance represented or held out by that person to be sub a substance.

(2) No person shall for the purpose of trafficking, possess a substance included Schedule I, II, III, or IV.

The charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking consists of the offence of possession plus an intention to traffic. No actual trafficking needs to be proved by the Crown. The onus on the Crown involves proving intent to traffic and since it commonly occurs that there is no direct proof trafficking per se, evidence is often circumstantial. Typical evidence used by the Crown includes: the amount and value of the drugs seized; exhibits that indicate sales activities such as scales and debt lists; observations by the police of the accused associating with known drug traffickers and/or users; and electronic surveillance indicating drug sales activities.

## 5. Importing and Exporting

Section 6.1 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act makes it an offence to import or export controlled substances into or out of Canada. The offence is punishable by a maximum term of life imprisonment for Schedule I and II substances, ten years for Schedule III and IV drugs; and up to three years for drugs listed in Schedule V and VI.

## Drug Usage and Social Policy

## The Liberalization/Prohibition Debate

The debate over Canadian drug policies has been ongoing for several decades. The conflicting demands made on the federal government during the late 1960s regarding drug legislation led to the formation of the five member Le Dain Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs.

The commissioners reached consensus on the importance of education, treatment, and rehabiliation but there was less agreement on the need for law reform and the role of legal sanctions in combatting drug usage. Both the Cannabis Report and the Final Report contained a marjority and two minority reports on the subject of appropriate legal controls.

One minority report, for instance, recommended the elimination of criminal controls for simple possession of amphetamines, opiate narcotics, cocaine, and marijuana; another minority report recommended that all legal penalities be retained for these drugs; and, the majority supported the abolition of the offence for cannabis only.

Since the Le Dain Commission submitted its report in 1972, the federal government has vacillated back and forth occasionally announcing plans to decriminalize marijuana but later retreating from making any legal reform in a process referred to as "the saga of promise, hesitation, and retreat."

The debate over how society should regulate psychoactive and habit-forming substances--particularly heroin, cocaine, and marijuana--tends to fall into two polar extremes: the conservative side, which supports harsh prohibition; and the liberal side, which proposes sweeping legalization.

The prohibitionists have been the clear winners in this controversy since most countries in the world prohibit and punish possession and trafficking of a variety of drugs. Nonetheless, the debate continues with more and more propoenents campaigning for a relaxation of the prohibition against the use of certain drugs.

Prohibitionists support strict legal penalties against currently illicit drugs and attribute the widespread availability and use of drugs to ineffective law enforcement and soft penalties. Consequently, many would like to see greater resources given to the police and harsher penalties for drug-related offences.

People who propose a more liberal approach argue that prohibitionist policies do more harm than good and are largely to blame for the disease and violent crime that surround drug usage. They would like to see our drug laws reformed and replaced with a system of regulations similar to the way in which society deals with tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs.

The following is a summary of the legalization debate and the key arguments that distinguish both sides. The reader should keep in mind that many of the proponents on both sides employ one-sided arguments to further their aims and are quite selective in highlighting the particular dimensions of harm that serve their rhetorical purposes.

## The Prohibitionist Model -- Arguments Against Legalization

Prohibitionists have both moral and practical reasons for opposing the liberalization of drug laws. On the one hand, they condemn drug use as immoral behaviour and oppose drcriminalization or legalization because such a move they believe endorses drug usage and sends the wrong message to the public.

On the practical side, prohibitionists argue that any liberalization in drug laws will lead to an increase in the number of drug users and/or addicts along with an increase in drug-related crime, family conflicts, and a variety of social and health problems.

From their perspective, prohibitionism symbolically condemns drug usage as immoral and harmful, makes drugs less accessible, and deters many from using drugs. Prohibitionists admit that although law enforcement cannot eliminate illicit drugs, it at least keeps a lid on the problem and leads to less usage and fewer drug-related problems. By offering some degree of deterrence, prohibition sends out the message that drug usage is wrong, is punishable by legal sanctions, and it discourages an unknown number of persons from experimenting with drugs.

Prohibitionists argue that if drug use were legalized, the number of drug users would rise. For one thing, the stigma attached to these drugs would be reduced; the price would drop significantly; availability would increase; quality would be regulated; there would be no fear of arrest; and industry advertising and marketing could lead target audiences to experiment with these substances. The result is likely to be more users and more addicts.

## The Liberalization Model -- Arguments in Favour of Legalization

Reformers acknowledge that on the surface, it seems paradoxical to argue that we can decrease the problems associated with drug use by legalizing the very behavior that is problematic.

Even people, who acknowledge that out present policies are largely ineffective, reasonably wonder whether it would be right to add to the list of harmful substances that are legally available. For one thing, no one knows how demand may respond to lower prices and the legalization of drugs.

Advocates of the liberalization model argue, however, that there are complex and unintended costs of prohibitionist policies--increased crime and corruption, disease, financial costs, the harm done by the criminal justice system, racial tension and disparity, and the loss of civil liberties--and that these harms grossly outweigh the benefit society gains from banning drugs.

There is also the argument that prohibition is ineffective in dealing with drug usage and drug trafficking. Law enforcement efforts to stem the flow of drugs by pursuing traffickers are doomed because drugs are too profitable and whenever the police arrest one dealer, the void is filled by another.

Despite the fact that law enforcement agencies have developed innovative ways to convict drug dealers, the best they are able to do is to to keep a lid on the market. After all, the real problem is demand. Drugs offer a pleasurable experience and as long as there is high demand and high profits, people will be willing to traffic despite vigilant law enforcement and harsh penalties.

Critics of present policies argue that the war on drugs has led to an erosion of civil liberties because drug investigations require informants, wiretaps, and undercover tactics that are highly proactive and intrusive in the lives of citizens.

One of the more serious victims of the war on drugs in justice systems throughout the world. Numerous countries fill their jails with drug users whose behaviour is not more threatening than that of people who drink alcohol. Unfortunately, many emerge from prison more harmed and more dangerous than when they go in and this in itself engenders disrespect for the law and the justice system.

Prohibitionist policies are also criticized for being divisive and racist since the damage inflicted falls disproportionately on poor countries and on poor people of minority status in rich countries. In the United States, for example, thousands of young blacks and Hispanics are imprisoned for minor drug offences.

Although blacks make up only 12 percent of the general population, they constitute two-thirds of admission to sate prisons for drug offences. A similar disproportion exists for Hispanics who represent 10 percent of the population but constitute 25 percent of all those sent to prison for drug offences. It is not surprising that these laws have increased suspicion in the black community that drug enforcement is an instrument of continuing white oppression (Reuter, 1997:268).

Even taking into account economic factors, prohibitionism is extremely expensive and wasteful. In the U.S., for instance, drug control is estimated to cost between $30-35 billion dollars annually--money critics argue could be better spent on employment, education, and treatment programs.

There is also a huge loss of potential revenue since all drug profits are funnelled into the hands of dealers. This is money that could otherwise be taxed and used as government revenues as is done with other vices such as gambling, tobacco, and alcohol.

The liberalization model is a less moralistic approach because it accepts drug usage without moral condemnation. Instead, liberal social policy advocates a utilitarian and pragmatic approach to the drug problem that emphasizes practical and effective measures to reduce the harm now being imposed on society.

This "harm reduction model" focuses on reducing health problems, violence, and the harsh legal penalties used to punish drug users, and brings with it a more humanitarian and therapeutic perspective. The liberal perspective views drug use an addiction as a lifestyle choice and/or public health problem rather than a crime.

A harm reduction model stresses the need for a shift in resources away from enforcement and towards prevention, education, and treatment and supports initiatives such as methadone programs, needle-exchange centers, and prescription heroin.

## Drug Specific Legal Reform

The prohibition/liberalization debate has tended to ignore the differences between the current illicit substances and treat them in a similar fashion. Before drug laws are liberalized, however, it is no doubt wise to first evaluate each type of drug, consider their effects and potential for harm, and develop drug specific regulations.

Just as legal drugs are available through different channels--caffeine from any cafe, alcohol only with proof of age, Prozac only on prescription--so the drugs that are now illegal might one day be distributed in different ways, based on knowledge about their potential for harm. Moreover, different countries should experiment with different solutions.

Based on their potential for harm, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and designer drugs should all have different regulations. Marijuana is likely to have the least restrictive controls since it is non-addictive and has relatively few health concerns. Many otherwise law-abiding and productive citizens use marijuana recreationally and there is widespread support for the decriminalization or legalization of this substance.

Advocates of drug policy reform are frequently categorized into two camps: (A) decriminalizers support the legal ban on the sale of current illicit substances but favour a reduction in criminal sanctions for possession of small amounts of drugs; (B) legalizers, on the other hand, propose making the sale and use of illicit drugs legal while at the same time maintaining some government regulation and control. The legalization position places fewer restrictions on who can use, sell, or administer drugs but there are restrictions nonetheless.

In general, reformers argue that present illicit drugs should be regulated in a manner similar to alcohol and tobacco and argue that liberalizing drug laws will significantly reduce the black market for drugs, drug-related crime and violence, the potential for the corruption of officials, wasted expenditures on the criminal justice system, and the unnecessary suffering that a punitive prohibitionist policy inflicts on so many users and other minor offenders.

Legalization will allow society to regulate drug sales and gain control over a problem that has resisted being controlled through coercive means.

Besides making the case that liberalization will have practical benefits for society, reformers present moral and philosophical arguments based on their concern for justice, compassion, and freedom. They condemn the fact that so many young persons and members of minority groups are brutally punished for minor offences.

They also criticize the laws as hypocritical and unjust because society tolerates other harmful substances such as alcohol and tobacco. Reformists further argue that democratic societies should maximize the freedom of its citizens including the freedom to engage in behaviour that they may be harmful to oneself.

Reformists also argue that a regulated and legal market gives society greater control over drug usage and is the most effective way of minimizing the danger and harm associated with this activity. Through regulations, society can control the strength and the quality of drugs sold, exclude purchases by minors, and oversee health-related issues.

Removal of the ban on drugs would make it easier to treat the problems of addiction and prevent the spread of diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis. What is envisioned is a system of laws and regulations similar to those that govern the sale and distribution of alcohol and tobacco.

The experience with Prohibition in the U.S. during the years 1919-1932 is also used by many to attack the present prohibitionist policy on drug usage. During the 13 years that the sale of alcohol was prohibited in the U.S., the illegal market flourished and gave rise to violent organized crime and the widespread corruption of law enforcement.

One lesson that should be learned from the "Great Experiment" with alcohol prohibition is that banning drugs is not the best way to protect society from harm. The war on drugs has had a negative effect on countries throughout the world and a devastating impact in developing countries such as Columbia where the very foundations of democracy has come under attack by drug fuelled conflicts.

## An International Perspective

In July 2002, England announced plans to liberalize drug policy regarding the use of marijuana so that possession of small quantities will no longer be treated as a crime. The country is also reviving a decades old policy  that allows medical practitioners to prescribe heroin to addicts. These changes have brought Britain into line with a number of other European countries including Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, and Netherlands, and Belgium, who have begun to decriminalize various drugs.

Whereas the U.S. public tend to view illegal drug usage as a crime that needs to be solved by punishment, European nations generally see drug usage primarily as a lifestyle choice and/or health problem that requires a more therapeutic approach. Several European countries support treatment of addicts and other pragmatic policies such as needle exchange programs aimed at reducing the spread of HIV.

Despite an increasing tolerance of drug usage, Western European countries remain firmly prohibitionist when  it comes to drug trafficking. Drug  trafficking  laws are harsh, vigorously enforced, and courts issue relatively punitive sentences.

From a global perspective, the main engine of the "war on drugs" and the major source of prohibitionist sentiment is the United States. During the Cold War, the U.S. managed to enshrine its prohibitionist views in international law by a series of United Nations treaties that make it impossible for national legislatures to legalize the commonly used recreational drugs.

Without the United State's agreement, countries can do little more than decriminalize the possession and use of some currently illicit drugs. Critics argue that the effects of America's misdirected policies spill across the world. Other rich countries that try to change their policies meed fierce American resistance; poor countries that ship drugs (as Latin American experience shows) come under huge pressure to prevent the trade, whatever the cost to civil liberties or the environment.

At present, many countries are bound by a United Nations convention that hampers even the most modest moves towards liberalization. Many scholars contend that the problems associated with illicit drug usage have less to do with social policy than other societal problems. Social factors such as racism and discrimination, social inequality, poverty and unemployment, dysfunctional families, and weak informal social controls promote the use of illicit drugs and make worse the problems associated with their usage.

Discussions concerning law reform have largely been won by the law enforcement side, which consistently raises the spectre of organized crime, increased drug addiction, and other social ills. Debates have typically omitted objective assessments of the physiological effects of the opiates themselves, the true extent of the drug/crime problem, and the public health implications. In much of their campaign against substance abuse, prohibitionists have combined scare tactics with moralizing to dissuade young persons from using illicit drugs. These tactics have had limited success because users have seen from experience that many illicit drugs can be used in moderation without harming oneself or others.

For the past century, Canadian and U.S. drug-control efforts have relied primarily on a policy of deterrence and the efforts of law enforcement to limit supply. Given the fact that illicit drugs are still readily available, law enforcement and imprisonment are extremely costly, and that drug usage and abuse is an ongoing problem, many professionals and lay persons view the prohibitionist approach as a failure. Scholars, researchers, and treatment specialists, however, continue to play a minimal role in the development of drug policies. Like the U.S., Canada usually ignores its drug professionals when developing laws related to the non-medical use of drugs.

Most North American criminologies and drug researchers are generally critical of a harsh prohibitionist policy and tend to favour more tolerant and treatment-based intervention. These involve harm-reduction strategies that attempt to minimize the non-medical use of both illicit drugs and licit ones such as tobacco and alcohol; a focus on health factors rather than on prohibition; the controlled legalized sale of opiates to drug-dependant persons; and the decriminalization of at least some illegal drugs.
