# Module 12: Laws and Social Policy Related to Prostitution -- The Legislation of Morality

## A Brief Historical Overview of Canada's Prostitution Laws

Must of Canada's Criminal Code comes from our British heritage. Laws dealing with prostitution in Canada reflect British laws that criminalize the keeping of "bawdy houses" and earlier vagrancy statutes (1824 The Vagrancy Act). Historically, the keeping of bawdy-houses was viewed as corrupting of public morals and a threat to social order since they attracted disreputable and rowdy clients.

Laws against prostitution go back as far as the eighteenth century in Canada and focused on homeless, destitute, and the unemployed. Canada's Criminal Code in the late nineteenth century (1892) contained vagrancy laws that prohibited bawdy houses, streetwalking, and living off the avails of prostitution. Only women were defined as prostitutes and the laws were clearly discriminatory against them.

Vagrancy laws that included prostitution related offences in Canada were repealed in 1972 and replaced by Section 195.1 which made it an offence for any person to solicit in a public place for the purpose of prostitution. Canada still has a vagrancy law (Sec. 179) but this is limited to person who support themselves through gambling or crime.

Former Section 195.1 (known as the solicitation offence--repealed) used to make it an offence to "solicit" any person in a public place for the purpose of prostitution. However, the courts ruled that soliciting had to be "pressing and persistent" to constitute an offence (Hutt, 1978). This decision made the law difficult to enforce and one of the consequences is that the police stopped laying charges of soliciting except exceptional cases.

In 1985, the soliciting law was replaced with Sec. 213(1) and is known as the "communication" offence. This section makes it an offence to (1) stop or attempt to stop a person in order to communicate for the purpose of prostitution, and (2) communicating or attempting to communicate for the purpose of prostitution. The courts have ruled that there must be proof of an intention (mens rea) to engage in sexual services in order to constitute an offence of communicating for the purpose of prostitution. Intention can be inferred from the words and actions of the accused. Courts have ruled that references to many and payment is evidence of intent. Following the directions of a prostitute is also evidence.

The main purpose of Section 213 is to maintain social order and prevent people from being propositioned on the street.

## Types of Prostitution

Research in all countries indicates that prostitution typically involves women offering sexual services to make clients for money. Although some men also provide sexual services for money, their clients are also typically other males.

The following discussion will focus primarily on the most common form of prostitution in which women prostitute themselves to male clients for money.

Research on prostitution also indicates that there is a hierarchy within prostitution and that sexual services are offered in different ways to different types of clientele. Higher socioeconomic customers tend to frequent more exclusive services such as "call girls" who work out of public view and meet clients in hotels, apartments, or private homes. Most escort agencies also provide sexual services in similar settings.

These higher level prostitutes charge higher prices and are typically young and attractive well dressed women. This is a requirement to attract good paying clients in a very competitive business.

Call girls and escort agencies often advertise openly without being subject to police actions. These advertisements do not violate communication laws and few people complain. There are many magazines, newspapers, and online sites that carry classified advertisements for sexual services. NOW magazines, for example, is a prominent Toronto publication that focuses on the entertainment scene and carries extensive advertisements for sexual related services in their publication and online.

Massage parlours may also be fronts for prostitution and are fairly discrete in the manner in which they provide sexual services. They are generally classified as a middle level service between call girls and street level prostitution.

At the bottom of the hierarchy are what are known as street prostitutes. These are women who advertise their services by standing on street corners and communicating with potential clients through dress, eye contacts, and verbal entreaties. They are often older and less attractive than call girls.

These women tend to conduct their business in cars, public places (e.g., parks) or cheap hotel rooms.

Research on street prostitutes indicate that they tend to be lower socioeconomic class, have often been abused, come from dysfunctional homes, are over-representative of minority groups, and suffer from substance abuse. They are often viewed and portrayed as victims in many ways.

Street level prostitutes are more visible, subject to neighborhood complains, and thus more vulnerable to arrest. They are also more likely to subject to violence by clients.

## Current Laws -- Canada's Criminal Code -- Prostitution Related Offences

Prostitution (the sale/purchase of sexual services) is not an offence in Canada. However, there are several prostitution related behaviors that are found in the Criminal Code.

Prostitution laws in Canada deal with three main issues: (1) communicating in a public place for the purpose of selling or purchasing sexual services (Sec. 213); bawdy house offences (Sec. 210); and (3) procuring and living off of the avails of prostitution (Sec. 212).

These laws collectively attempt to regulate some of the public and nuisance behaviors associated with what is called street prostitution. Generally speaking, higher level prostitutes maintain low visibility and are not the subject of citizen complaints. Because the police are mainly reactive (respond to citizen complains or requests for assistance), higher level prostitutes are less to be arrested for prostitution related offences than street level hookers.

## Communication Sec. 213 C.C.C.

Sec. 213(1) Every person who in a public place or in any place open to public view

(a) stops or attempts to stop a vehicle,

(b) impedes the free flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic or ingress to or egress from premises adjacent to that place, or

(c) stops or attempts to stop any person  or in any manner communicates or attempts to communicate with any person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution or of obtaining the sexual services of a prostitute is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

(2) Definition of a "public place"--In this section, "public place" includes any place to which the public have access as of right or by invitation, express or implied, and any motor vehicle located in a public place or in any place open to public view.

## Enforcement

Section 213 makes it an offence for the prostitute and/or the client to communicate for the purpose of prostitution.

The police attempt to enforce the law in two ways: they use undercover to engage in conversations with either street prostitutes or the Johns and arrest them if they communicate for the purpose of prostitution. This is not considered entrapment if the police act on reasonable suspicion and simply provide suspects with an opportunity to break the law by communicating for the purpose of prostitution.

It is clear from many studies, however, that Section 213 is not enforced equally and that the police target prostitutes much more than their clients (known as Johns). Many studies indicate that far more women are charged under Sec. 213 than male clients.

## Bawdy-houses -- Sec. 210(1) C.C.C.

Sec. 210(1) keeping a common bawdy-house

## Procuring -- Sec. 212(1) C.C.C.

Sec. 212(1) Procuring

(b) uses, threatens to use or attempt to use violence, intimidation or coercion in relation to the person under that age, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years but not less than five years.

## The Prohibition or Criminalization Model -- The Punitive Approach

There are two basic approaches to dealing with prostitution and these approaches represent different ideologies (systems of beliefs and values) and legal approaches to this behavior.

The prohibition model views prostitution as morally wrong and encourages harsh laws and strict law enforcement and punishment of prostitution related behaviors. This model advocates a crime control model for dealing with prostitution related activities.

This prohibition is moralistic and is promoted by religious groups and some feminists. It views prostitution as evil and prostitutes as victims of an oppressive, exploitive, and patriarchal (male dominated) society.

From this perspective, women are treated as sexual commodities by men and exploited and subjected to degrading and violent practices.

These groups (referred to as moral entrepreneurs) often oppose the liberalizing of laws and mount moral crusades against the evils of prostitution.

They also tend to advocate harsh laws particularly against men who profit from prostitution. The long term goal of this moral ideology is to eliminate prostitution as a viable endeavour.

It is acknowledged by many, however, that eliminating prostitution would require changing society so that women are no longer exploited socially and economically. Poverty, unequal pay, limited economic opportunities, etc. are seen as being at the root cause of prostitution.

Other changes needed include a dismantling of the values and ideology of a patriarchal society that views women as second class citizens.

## The Harm Reduction Model -- Regulating Prostitution -- Legalization and Decriminalization -- The Liberal Approach

This model tends to ignore moral issues related to prostitution and takes a more practical approach to dealing with problems associated with prostitution related activities. It is a liberal and utilitarian approach that advocates a harm reduction and order maintenance model for dealing with the problem of prostitution related activities.

From this perspective, prostitution is here to stay and cannot be eliminated through punitive laws and law enforcement. The main goal is to regulate and control prostitution and diminish the harmful effects on women and society as a whole.

At the heart of this argument is an acknowledgement that there are problems related to prostitution and some form of government regulation is required (similar to regulations dealing with the sale and distribution of alcohol and tobacco).

One way in which prostitution is regulated is by limiting activities to designated areas of a city and licensing and monitoring prostitutes. This may include mandatory health check-ups, licensing fees, taxation, etc. Decriminalization means removing most of the laws from the Criminal Code that prohibit prostitution-related activities.

Legalization means removing all laws that criminalize prostitution and this would allow prostitutes to conduct their activities like any legitimate business.

Most people who advocate a harm reduction model favour a decriminalization approach and wish to retain some laws particularly those that punish the use of violence and coercion against prostitutes. They argue that a policy of decriminalization will diminish or eliminate most of the harmful side effects of prostitution including disease, violence, and the exploitation of women by pimps and human traffickers.

Under this model, prostitution will not have to operate underground and prostitutes can seek protection of law enforcement and access both criminal and civil courts if they are victimized. Prostitutes will have access to better health care and can conduct their business in safe and supervised environment rather than on dimly lit or darkened streets where they are most vulnerable.

Advocates also argue that society can benefit by taxing these activities in the same manner that all commercial activities are taxed.

In the early 1980's, the Federal government of Canada convened the Special Committee on Pornography and Prostitution (FRaser Committee, 1985) to examine prostitution and make recommendations concerning public policy. The FRaser Committee proposed a combination of legalization and decriminalization approach to deal with prostitution related activities. The Committee proposed that the government remove all criminal law except those provisions dealing with nuisance activities, exploitation, and violence. They recommended that prostitutes be licensed and be allowed to work in private residence where they could be offered greater personal security. Street prostitution would still be controlled through laws that prohibited nuisance behaviors. Living off the avails legislation would be limited to actions that were judged to be coercive.

Although well received by the public, no Canadian government has had the appetite to move in the direction of legalization/decriminalization. Instead, Canadian governments have continued to support a criminalization and punitive approach to problems associated with prostitution;

## The Feminist Perspective on Prostitution and Prostitution Laws

Feminist scholars tend to fall into two different camps with respect to their views on prostitution. Although most feminists view prostitution and related activities as harmful to  women, they differ sharply on what should be done and the role of law in dealing with these issues.

One group of feminist scholars are known as liberal-feminists and they advocate for the rights of prostitutes to work without fear of arrest and detention. They recognize that some women enter prostitution by choice and that their right to work in this area should be respected.

They support decriminalizing prostitution as means of respecting women's rights to choose and to minimize the harm that comes with this activity. Many prostitutes and ex-prostitutes take this position and view prostitution as a form of work that should not be criminalized.

This group supports a harm reduction approach to prostitution and wishes to ensure that laws and social policies allow women to work in this profession in a safe environment. They typically oppose laws and law enforcement that force street prostitutes to move into dark and dangerous industrial areas of the city to ply their trade. They also tend to support repealing laws against the establishment of bawdy-houses so that women can practice their trade in a safe environment.

The second group, known as radical-feminists, views prostitution as degrading, oppressive, and harmful to women. They see prostitution as resulting from a patriarchal system that devalues women and treats them as a sexual commodity.

From this perspective, prostitution is always in some degree or other the result of coercion either directly (such as through pimps) or indirectly (such as through limited job opportunities).

Both groups--liberal and radical-feminists--would like to change patriarchal attitudes and values and improve economic conditions for women so that they have greater economic choices and opportunities. This will help reduce the need for many women to prostitute themselves in order to make a living.

## Worldwide Trends

Prostitution is viewed and treated differently in countries around the world. In some jurisdictions, prostitution is illegal and accompanied by harsh penalities. Sweden has taken this approach and recently increased penalities for prostitution related activities.

Other countries such as Canada do not criminalize prostitution per se but make related activities subject to criminal sanctions.

In both instances, women are disproportionately subject to penalities over their male customers.

There is a recent trend in some countries, however, to decriminalize prostitution and related activities. The Netherlands formally legalized prostitution in 2000 and Germany and New Zealand did the same in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Some jurisdictions such as Germany made these changes with little concern from the public while others such as New Zealand had to deal with strong and vocal opposition.

In Canada, the Federal government seems content to respect the status quo and it appears that the current laws related to prostitution are unlikely be changed in the near future.
