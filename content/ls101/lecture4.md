# Module 4: Two Models of the Criminal Process

## The Crime Control Model

The crime control mode represents traditional values in Canadian society. The British North America Act of 1867 emphasizes "Pease, Order and Good Government."

This model assumes that crime and social disorder threaten our liberty and that freedom is only possible with social order.

Maintaining social order and repressing crime is the most important function of the criminal justice system. There is a basic trust in the justice system and the values of the crime control model are respectful of authority.

Society gives up some of its liberty in order to gain protection from crime and from those who disrupt the social order. Most citizens are unconcerned about diminished right because they are law abiding anyway. Excessive rights only benefit criminals.

Liberty in a democratic society is never total but is always constrained. For instance, your freedom to throw a punch ends where my chin begins.

A crime control model places faith in the police force. The police are seen as the "good guys" and play an important and positive role in society. The crime control model represents the values of the police whereas the due process model represents the value system that the law profession stands for. The differences in value orientation helps to explain the underlying tension and conflict between these two professions.

Police must be given the resources necessary to investigate crime, arrest and charge offenders, and obtain convictions. Police operate on a presumption of guilt.

One of the most significant resources is the law. Laws must give the police the powers necessary to do the job. Laws should be "enabling". (E.g., writs of assistance, the War Measures Act).

The value system underlying a crime control model emphasizes social order; the punishment and deterrence of criminal conduct; and, concern for victims and victim rights.

Also emphasized are the ends -- the protection of society and criminal convictions vs. the means. Thus the rights of the public outweigh the rights of individual citizens. The public is willing to overlook excessive zeal in law enforcement. The courts allow evidence that has been obtained illegally as long as it does not bring the criminal justice system into disrepute.

Concern with efficiency in the operation of the criminal process. Efficiency means a high capacity to apprehend, try, convict, and dispose of offenders. The system is described as "assembly line justice" and must be able to function with a large number of cases on limited resources. There is a premium on informality, speed, and finality. The operating principle for the crime control model is the presumption of guilt.

The crime control model is characterized as a conservative, harsh, and punitive approach to dealing with crime and social deviance. It can be encapsulated in the phrase: "Throw the book at them."

## The Due Process Model

This is the emerging Canadian model and the traditional U.S. model. The American Declaration of Independence, 1776, emphasizes the principle of "Life, Liberty, and Freedom".

This model assumes that the greatest threat to our freedom comes from the misuse of power and authority. There is a fundamental distrust of authority and government and in particular, the police. Underlying this model is an anti-authoritarian value system. The law profession subscribes to the due process model and are socialized into the values that underlie it.

The powers given to the police and other agencies must be severely limited and monitored. The police are a "necessary evil" and they must be made accountable for their actions.

The protection of individual rights is given the highest priority and is enshrined in a constitution and/or charter of rights. These rights act as a counterbalance to the awesome powers of the state. Individual rights help to protect citizens from restrictive, coercive, and punitive actions by persons in authority.

Police must operate under the strict rule of law. Laws limit police powers and are experienced by the police as impediments to criminal investigation and order maintenance.

Evidence obtained illegally and/or in violation of an individual's rights is ruled inadmissible in law.

The operating principle is the presumption of innocence. The basic value orientation is reflected by the phrase: "It is better that a hundred guilty persons go free than to have one innocent person convicted."

The due process model demands a formal, adjudicative, adversarial process headed by an impartial tribunal, judge, and/or jury.

The model stresses the possibility of error and bias particularly against minorities and the poor. Mistakes (e.g., the Donald Marshall case) are used as evidence to argue the process needs reform and increasing vigilance. A due process model will accept less efficiency in order to prevent mistakes. It is a more expensive and time consuming model for processing cases and emphasizes "quality control" as opposed to speed.

In this model, emphasis is placed on legal guilt as opposed to factual guilt. Defense lawyers are less interested in whether or not their client "did it". They are more concerned with whether or not the police and Crown can prove their case and whether or not their client's rights have been respected.

The law will allow a guilty person to go free if the police or courts have not acted in a strictly legal fashion. Courtroom procedures are characterized by "legal formalism".

The emphasis is on the means (the process by which the system operates) as opposed to the ends (convicting criminals and maintaining order). The use of appeals increases. More laws are struck down by the Supreme court.

The due process model is characterized as a liberal model and can be encapsulated by the phrase: "Doing it by the book".

## Critique of Both Models

Need to strike a balance between the two models. Maximize liberty yet still protect society and potential victims from crime. Have to be cautious not to see one as good and the other as bad because there are good arguments to support both and benefits that can be achieved from each model.

People will have their value preferences, however. Both models emphasize the role of law although each views law as having different purposes -- protecting society vs. protecting individual rights.

Ideally, laws should enable the police to do their job yet still afford citizens with protections against the abuse of power.

Obvious benefits of the due process model are evident in changes to The Mental Health Act. A due process model protects ordinary individuals in their jobs from such problems as sexual harassment, prejudice and discrimination, sexism, and any arbitrary misuse of power. People in positions of authority are not accountable for their actions and this protects persons in weaker and vulnerable positions within organizations.

Similar changes from the old Juvenile Delinquent's Act to the newer Young Offender's Act have been criticized for bring an adversarial model to the juvenile justice system; for criminalizing young offenders; for overly protecting young criminals, etc.

Under a due process model, critics argue that the rights of individuals are too often given priority over the rights of society.

An obstructionist and expensive model that costs taxpayers millions of dollars to process criminals.

The due process model allows criminals to go free on legal technicalities.

A due process model places no emphasis on responsibility as a citizen.

Rights should not be extended to non-citizens. (E.g., R. v Ng)

Rights of victims to see that justice has been done is ignored by an exclusive focus on offender rights.

The due process model is criticized for giving the judiciary and in particular the Supreme Court of Canada near legislative powers and a veto over a freely elected democratic and accountable Parliamentary government. The judiciary are not accountable nor are they representative or in tune with the diverse needs and values of Canadian society.

The Constitution gives powers to the judiciary and this acts as a system of checks and balances against the parliamentary system. Unfair laws can now be successfully challenged in the courts.

Dissatisfaction with the non-consultative process by which members of the Supreme Court are appointed. Supreme Court Justices do not represent the diverse mosaic of Canadian society.

A due process models has a legalistic bias. The Supreme Court bases their decisions on strictly legal criteria with little regard for the social consequences of such decisions. (R. v Askov: decision regarding the rights to consult a lawyer when charged with impaired driving). Such decisions so offend the value system of the Canadian public that they bring the criminal justice system into disrepute.

Increasing concern with vigilantism if people lose faith in this system and begin to take justice into their own hands.

A due process model challenges the police by making them more accountable. The public still expects the police to maintain order and solve crimes but they must do so within the confines of the law and respectful of civil liberties. Police must be better trained, prepared, and professional in doing their job. Sufficient resources must be provided for recruitment, training and education.

Canadian values are changing towards a greater acceptance of due process in everyday activities. In the past, police violations of the law (e.g., the MackDonald Commission, the Morand Commission) were largely overlooked. The public was unconcerned about the widespread violations of the law by the police in their attempts to apprehend criminals. Not so today.

Police are less likely these days to abuse authorities. But evolving problems may result in apathy and/or poor job morale for the police if they are prevented from enforcing the law and bringing to justice people who are guilty of criminal offenses.

Leading to the "Americanization" of Canada and the introduction of an individualistic, adversarial, and litigious value system.
