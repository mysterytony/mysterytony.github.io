# Module 10: Family Law and Social Policy: Marriage and Divorce Laws

## The Sacred Concept of Marriage

Marriage is defined as divine and a holy institution since it is created and blessed by God. This is a traditional view of marriage and one in which authority is granted to the Church and religious authorities. Marriage is seen as a contract with God and one what is permanent. Thus divorce is nor permissible.

Marriage requires self-sacrifice (even suffering) since the desires of individuals are secondary to the obligations to follow God's will. There is an emphasis on duty, responsibility, sacrifice, and rigid conformity to Church laws. Individuality and individual rights are suppressed because of one's obligations to Church, society, family and kin.

## The Social Concept of Marriage

This also represents a traditional view of marriage and is similar to the sacred concept. It focuses on social (rather than sacred) obligations. Authority is centered in the kinship group, community, and the Church and there is a concern with maintaining social respectability.

There is an emphasis on conformity to community norms and the demands of one's family and kinship network. Extended family groups exert great social control on individuals and rigid conformity to norms are demanded. Power resides in the elders and typically with men.

Self-sacrifice is required and individual needs are secondary to the demands of society. Thus divorce is stigmatizing and not permissible. Nor is pre-martial sex, homosexuality, or inter-racial marriage. Women are typically subject to the authority of men, their sexuality is strictly controlled, and arranged marriages are often practiced.

## The Personal Concept of Marriage

There is a more modern view of marriage and one that gives priority to individual rights, needs, and desires. Individuals have personal freedom to marry, whom to marry, when they should marry, and whether or not they will seek a divorce. Marriage is a personal decision made free from the control of Church and family.

People are free to choose to their own mate and theoretically and lawfully, they can marry across racial and ethnic boundaries (relative freedom). Marriage exists for the individual and there is a concern with "self" and "self-actualization", personal fulfillment, and happiness. the personal concept is based on more hedonistic values and respect for individual rights.

## Jurisdiction over Marriage and the Family

Canada has a divided jurisdiction in matters of family law.

The *British North American Act 1867* gave the federal government the power to legislate with respect to marriage and divorce. The *Divorce Act* is a federal legislation and divorces are heard in Superior courts.

The power to solemnize a marriage, however, was given to the provinces. Provinces also have the power the right to legislate in relation to matrimonial property, the support of spouses and children, custody issues, succession, adoption, and guardianship.

Issues such as custody, property disputes, and support are heard in provincial courts if they are not being determined in the context of a divorce in which case they will be heard along with the divorce petition in a Superior court.

## Defining Marriage

Marriage is a legal, social, moral, and religious contract between two consenting adults involved in a conjugal relationship. It is regulated by a massive and complex system of customs, norms, values, and laws. The precise form that marriages take is influenced by culture, subcultures, religion, law, and individual differences.

In 1978, the Ontario Family Law Reform Act moved the province towards a limited legal recognition of **common0law** marriages. This refers to a conjugal relationship between a couple in which no legal marriage has taken place. The Act defines a spouse for the purpose of support obligation as either a married person or a couple living together continuously for 5 years or within a relationship of some permanence where there is a child born and they have cohabited within the preceding year.

In July 2005, the government of Canada passed Bill C-38, which legalized **same-sex marriages**. This was in reaction to court decisions in British Columbia and Ontario that ruled that laws prohibiting same-sex marriages were unconstitutional because they violate equality rights. Same-sex marriages are currently recognized in Canada, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, and Spain.

Marriage is seen to have five main characteristics:

1. Marriage is a socially legitimate sexual union.
2. Marriage is a public affair and must be publically registered.
3. Marriage is undertaken with some idea of permanence.
4. Marriage involves emotional commitment and support.
5. Marriage is a legal contract with specific  rights and obligations.

Marriage has to be solemnized by a Judge, Justice of the Peace, or someone (e.g., clergy) authorized by the provincial government. Churches do not have the right to marry except if granted that right by the provincial government.

## Legal Requirement to Marry

To marry, each person must have the legal **capacity** to appreciate the nature and quality of the legal commitment and must do so freely. If **consent** is coerced or affected by alcohol or drugs, then the marriage can be declared void and an annulment granted.

Most jurisdictions prohibit marriages under a certain **age** and between close blood relatives (**kinship**). The minimum age at which a person can marry  varies from province to province with a range of 16-19 years. A legal marriage (or a divorce) in one jurisdiction is generally recognized as valid in another jurisdiction. Bigamy is prohibited in most jurisdictions and this refers to being married to more than one person at the same time (up to five years in prison in Canada). An **annulment** is granted when a marriage is deemed to have never been valid in the first place.

Ontario's Family Law Reform Act 1978 and the Family Law Act of 1986 made significant changes to the legal rights and obligations of martial partners. In Ontario, spouses have identical rights and obligations in marriage.

Spouses together take in hand and moral and material direction of the family, exercise parental authority, and assume the resulting tasks. the spouses choose the family residence together. the spouses contribute towards the expenses of the marriage in proportion to their respecting means. Ontario has abolished the distinction between **legitimate and illegitimate children**. Both have the same legal rights under the law.

Property rights differ significantly from province to province but in all cases, marriage creates a statutory right to share in the value of property acquired during the marriage.

The basic principle under the Family Law Act of Ontario is that "new family property" should be divided equally between the spouses unless an equal distribution would be manifestly **unfair**. Property includes "any interest, present or future, vested or contingent, in real or personal property." It includes pension, RSP's, business interests, stocks, etc.

## Divorce Legislation
People are required by law to obtain a divorce if they with to remarry

In 1970, the State of California became the first government in the Western world to institute no-fault divorce. The new law permitted either party to divorce when "irreconcilable differences caused the breakdown of the marriage."

**No-fault divorce laws** have shifted the focus of the legal process from the moral questions of fault and blames to economic issues of martial property, custody, and support.

The Divorce Act of 1968 made divorce easier to obtain in Canada and contained various grounds for divorce including provisions for a form of no-fault divorce. Section 3 allowed for a divorce on the grounds of adultery, sodomy, bestiality, rape, bigamy, and physical and mental cruelty. Section 4 granted a divorce when one spouse had been imprisoned, was addicted to drugs without a prospect of rehabilitation, failure to consummate a marriage, and martial breakdown.

The most significant addition to the act was Section 4(1) which allowed a divorce to be granted if a spouse could prove desertion and this involved proving that they had lived apart for three years. It also allowed for a divorce after living apart for five years with no requirement to prove desertion thus no longer requiring one party to prove "fault" in the other party.

Divorces increased dramatically after the Divorce Act of 1968 but critics argued that the provisions were still too restrictive and impractical and lobbied the government for more liberal grounds. They also argued that the practice of assigning fault for a marriage breakdown intensified rather than diminished the existing conflict between spouses and adversely affected settlements and custody issues.

The Divorce Act of 1985 further liberalized divorce laws and is still in effect today. The Federal Divorce Act 1985 allows couples to obtain a divorce on the grounds that there has been a breakdown of their marriage. Section 8 of the act reads as follows:

8(1) A court of competent jurisdiction may, on application by either or both spouses grant a divorce to the spouse or spouses on the ground that there has been a breakdown of their marriage.

Breakdown of a marriage is established if:

(a) The spouses have lived separate and apart for at least one year immediately preceding the determination of the divorce proceeding and were living separate and apart at the commencement of the proceedings; or

(b) The spouse against whom the divorce proceeding is brought has, since celebration of the marriage,

(i) Committed adultery, or

(ii) Treated the other spouse with physical or mental cruelty of such a kind as to render intolerable the continued cohabitation of the spouses

At the time the 1985 Act was passed, the federal Minister of Justice noted that shortening the separation period to one year from three years is designed to reduce the conflict between spouses and is long enough to give second thought and avoid rash and hasty divorces.

## Property

Older divorce laws allowed husbands to keep most of the family property if it was his income that paid for it. The law did not recognize the economic contribution of women in their roles as mother and housewife in the accumulation of family wealth.

Research examining the impact of divorce laws and court decisions indicate that **women and their children** typically experience a sharp decline in their standard of living after divorce.

The high divorce rate has vastly increased the number of single mothers who are left alone to support themselves and their minor children. Many of these women have been full-time mothers and housewives and are thus handicapped in their ability to make a living.

## Spousal and Child Support

Historically, spousal support originates from ecclsiastical law in England back when the Church still had jurisdiction over various martial issues. Later the concept of alimony developed in the common-law as a right that women only could exercise over their husbands after separation.

Legislative provisions for support payments indicate that the governments is willing to intervene in martial and family issues and impose legal obligations on the spouses (even in the case of common-law relationships).

In Ontario prior to 1978, only wives could obtain alimony and hand to apply through the Deserted Wives' and Children's Maintenance Act and had to show there was desertion by her husband and a failure to maintain her. Alimony was paid only in cases in which it was proved that:

1. The parties had a valid marriage;
2. The parties were living separate and apart; and
3. the husband was guilty of adultery, cruelty, or desertion. The wife had to prove that her husband was at fault in this way.

the husband could get out of paying alimony if he could prove adultery on the part of his wife.

Ontario abolished alimony in 1978 and replaced in with the concept of spousal support--a right that is gender-neutral since either spouse can claim support. This is found in the Family Law Act 1990. Not all provinces have legislation that allows common-law spouses to seek support payments.

Wives obtain custody of children in 85 to 90% of cases and courts typically order fathers to pay child support for these dependent children.

In determining the amount of support that should be awarded, the courts will look at a wide variety of factors including the applicant's financial needs; his/her capacity to become finanically independent; the length of time they were married or cohabited; their accustomed standard of living; the respondent's income and ability to afford support payments; and the obligation of the respondent to provide support for any other person (e.g., a new family, ailing parents, etc.). A spouse's misconduct is not a factor in awarding support.

The Federal Divorce Act (sec. 15.2(6)) sets out the policy objectives of an order for spousal support. The order should:

(a) Recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouses arising from the marriage or its breakdown;

(b) Apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of any child of the marriage;

(c) In sofar as is practicable, promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time.

The Family Law Act and the Divorce Act both place the primary obligation on spouses to support themselves to the extent that this is possible and practical.

Under the Ontario Family Law Act 1990, support is meant to serve a number of purposes:

(8) An order for support of a spouse should,

(a) Recognize the spouse's contribution to the relationship and the economic consequences of the relationship for the spouse;

(b) Share the economic burden of child support equitably

(c) Make fair provision to assist the spouse to become able to contribute to his or her own support; and

(d) Relieve financial hardship, it this has not been done by orders under Parts I (Family Property) and II (Matrimonial Home).

The Divorce Act of 1970 along with changes made in 1985 introduced the idea of economic self-sufficiency for women following the divorce and property settlement. The courts promoted a "clean break" model and tended to award the wife support for three years after which she was on her own and required to obtain a job and support herself.

The goal of economic self-sufficiency has been heavily criticized by women's groups because it often places an unreasonable and unrealistic expectation on thw wife to support herself after spending decades out of the workforce raising children and taking care of the home.

Beginning in the early 1990s, courts in Canada began to award greater spousal support and for much longer periods of time. Case law increasingly recognized the problem that women faced in the workplace and began to give less weight to the principle of economic self-sufficiency if it is unlikely to be realized. The courts have ruled that the objective of self-sufficiency is a goal "only insofar as in practicable."

Issues of child and spousal support are based in part on the law of contracts and require that both parties in a marriage to take on certain economic obligations even after the relationship has ended.

## Marriage Contracts and Separation Agreements

Prior to 1978 Ontario Family Law Reform Act, domestic contracts were severely limited in law because they were thought to undermine the stability of marriage (i.e., agreeing to conditions regarding separation and divorce before you even got married). Today, the Family Law Act 1986 allows a couple that marries or cohabits to construct a marriage or cohabitation agreement, which can include a separation agreement. These contracts must be in writing, signed by the parties, and witnessed.

Marriage contracts typically protect property that each person has brought into the marriage; divide property acquired during the marriage; limit support obligations; limit or eliminate support obligations for the other person's children, etc.

The terms of a marriage contract or a separation agreement are not necessarily binding on the court but they carry considerable weight. Marriage contracts can be disputed the same as any other contract on such grounds as fraud, duress, and misrepresentation. They can also be disputed on the grounds of **improvidence** (manifest unfairness), coercion, and non-disclosure of assets. Courts have ruled that both parties to a domestic contract must enter it in good faith.

Once a marriage or common-law relationship has ended, couples will often seek a **separation agreement** through their lawyers and will typically include a division of assets, provisions for spousal support, child support, custody and access to children, anything else the couple wishes, and a re-opening clause. A separation agreement, marriage contract, or a cohabitation agreement can be **enforced** just like any other contract. One party can use the other for non-performance or for default on payments owed. This allows them to collect the money through court orders, the seizure of assets, and by garnishing wages.
