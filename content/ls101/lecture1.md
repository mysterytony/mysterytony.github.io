# Module 1: Introduction to Legal Concepts: Functions of the Law, Alternative Dispute Resolution, and Administrative Law

## Introduction

Societies live according to rules, regulations, and laws. Law and our legal institutions play an increasingly important row in regulating our behavior. The law permeates all forms of social interaction and represents a complex and extensive system of social control.

Laws govern marriage and divorce, child custody and support, the speed limit, driver registrations, voting, business contracts, tuition fees, taxation, rent controls, inheritance and wills, property ownership, etc. It is difficult to think of anything in modern life that is not directly or indirectly influenced or governed by law. Even naming your child.

## Traditional vs. Complex Societies

Small traditional societies were relatively homogeneous and were able to function without laws but large industrial societies need laws to ensure that social order is maintained.

In traditional societies, people followed rules but these were norms, folkways, customs, and traditions. People were socialized into these norms and social control was informal - i.e., the norms were enforced by family, friends, and neighbors through praise or criticism, shame, ridicule, gossip, and even ostracism. religion played a significant role in the evolution of these customs and ensuring that people conformed to them.

As societies become larger and more complex, people no longer know one another as neighbors, society is more heterogeneous, and informal mechanisms of social control are less effective. People are strangers and act towards one another on the basis of roles.

Because there is great potential for conflict, there develops a need for explicit rules and regulations to govern conduct. Also needed as mechanisms for enforcing these rules and ensuring conformity. Commerce in particular requires a formal system that binds people to contracts and follows business to flourish.

Law refers to norms or rules that (1) have been established by a political body; (2) are enforced by threats of punishment or coercion; and (3) are enforced by persons or agencies who are authorized to do so. Law thus has a degree of legitimacy since it is passed by a government body and represents the interests of the state.

Laws are formal rules and regulations since they are typically written documents that are made public and include specific penalties and a formal system of social control (i.e., the police and the courts). Law is often seen as governmental mechanisms of social control. Law also symbolizes the use of power since the government must have the means (coercion) to pass and enforce laws.

## The Role of Lawyers

Lawyers play an adversarial role in society and concern themselves with resolving problems and disputes on behalf of their clients. Lawyers are professionals who are educated and trained in the practice of law and make a living doing so.

As much, lawyers approach a dispute as a competition in which they attempt to gain as much advantage as possible for their clients. This means that lawyers do not assess situations objectively and attempt to seek the truth. Instead, they look for weaknesses in the opponent's case and attempt to gain a victory on behalf of their client.

Lawyers are advocates for their client's cause and take all possible steps within legal and ethical boundaries to: (a) protect their client's rights; and (b) to achieve victory for their client. They can easily turn around and make the opposite arguments for a different client next week if paid to do so.

Sociologists, on the other hand, are social scientists and attempt to take a balanced approach to problems, be as objective as possible, and seek the truth. Sociologists should not be biased nor should they twist the facts to suit any preconceived beliefs or cases they may advocate.

Law is highly technical and lawyers are trained in its complex rules and regulations. Most people need lawyers in order to make their way through the courts. Lawyers occupy an intermediary position between their clients and the legal system. Lawyers take a personal complaint and turn into a legal cause that is actionable in law.

Lawyers are familiar with both the law and the operations of the courts yet only a small proportion are involved in actual litigation - i.e., lawsuits within the courtroom. Most deal with activities such as real estate transactions, wills, uncontested divorces, and other issues that do not require court attendance.

## Judges

Judges are the highest authority inside the courtroom and their power reaches well beyond the court into the community. The judge occupies a highly symbolic role and the courtroom is designed to reinforce his/her status. The judge sits at the front of the courtroom in a position that allows him/her to oversee and control the proceedings. His/her chair is higher than anyone else and is separated by a barrier. In addition, the judge has a private chamber, enters from a separate entrance, enters the courtroom last, his/her entrance is formally announced, and everyone in the courtroom is required to rise when told to do so.

The judge is addressed as "Your Honor" and the judge alone has the power to interpret the rules of law that govern the proceedings. Judges may also charge anyone who shows disrespect for his/her position or for the proceedings with contempt of court. This includes making disparaging comments, criticizing a ruling, or engaging in any act which is calculated to embarrass, hinder, or obstruct a court in the administration of justice, or which is calculated to lessen its authority or its dignity.

Judges enjoy high occupational prestige, authority, autonomy, job security, and salaries. In turn, they are expected to know the law and act in a fair and impartial manner towards the various players in the courtroom. The judge represents law and order and his/her behavior and words are often the measure of the fairness and humanity of our justice system.

Judges can be investigated for complaints by the Canadian Judicial Council and can be reprimanded and even removed from the bench for serious breaches of the law. A judge convicted of having sex with and assaulting teenage aboriginal girls in Alberta was convicted, sentenced to prison, and removed from the bench. The removal of a judge is extremely rare in Canada.

## Functions of the Law

There are five central functions to the law and these functions are similar to those of norms in general.

1.	Laws are Required to Maintain Social Control and Social Order

This is considered by many to be the main function of law -- to regulate behavior and maintain an orderly society.
Laws are blueprints for action and tell people what is expected. Implicit is the idea of power, authority, and sanctions.

Laws thus have a repressive function that is visible and recognizable and helps to ensure social control. The law is coercive and prescribes punishments for people convicted of violating its prohibitions. The law does not reward good behavior -- it simply punishes and represses wrongful acts.

As conflict theory suggests, some societies rely on repression more than others.

The law functions to make behavior predictable because it defines roles, rights, and responsibilities.

Many relationships are governed by laws and contracts (explicit or implicit) and these spell out required behaviors.

This makes behavior predictable and facilitates interaction. A necessity in a complex society such as ours.

The legal system does not have a monopoly on social control. Sociologists view other institutions such as the family, schools, and church as contributing more to social order than the justice system.

2.	Laws Help in Dispute Resolution

Laws assist in conflict resolution and offer a peaceful alternative to warfare and vengeance.

Laws prevent violence between neighbors to the extent that the authority of the law and our judicial system are respected and enforced.

As the pluralistic model of social order suggests, people in a heterogeneous society may not agree on fundamental values and this can result in conflict. Society can, however, develop mechanisms for conflict resolution that people accept as legitimate and use to resolve problems.

Laws and the judicial system are used to resolve conflicts and settle disputes on a daily basis in our society. People regularly use the courts and other conflict resolution systems to settle conflict in a peaceful and law abiding way.

To the extent that there is respect for the law, then citizens will use the law to settle social and economic conflict in a peaceful manner. The law provides a blueprint for dispute settlement and a basis for conclusive settlements.

This also helps to maintain the first function of law -- to preserve social order.

3.	Laws are Instruments of Social Change

Laws are used to implement social change. This is particularly true in a complex society like Canada.

This function of law is clearly evident in our legislatures when politicians justify laws and social policies in terms of the functions served by these legislative initiatives. Whether the laws are meant to reduce green house gases or protect consumers, the social change function is often clear.

Various interest groups continuously lobby government to pass laws to implement social and economic changes they value. Similarly, members of the public demand that governments "do something" about certain social problems. Doing something almost inevitably means passing new laws to implement social change.

In this sense, laws have an innovative and redistributive function since they can change society in various ways and significantly redistribute power, privileges, and resources.

4.	Laws Uphold Rights and Privileges and Define Duties and Obligations

Laws define duties and obligations assigned to various roles and enforces these with the coercive power of the state.

Laws also define the rights and privileges that go with various roles in society and legitimizes a person's claim to these rights.

Parents, for example, have many obligations to their children including providing food and shelter. They also have many rights with regards to their children including the right to choose their children's names, religion, school, place of residence, etc.

These rights and privileges are protected in law and these duties and obligations are enforced in law.

Because the rights and duties attached to various roles and widely known and understood, this also facilitates interaction between people and contributes to social order. We all know that a police officer has the right to stop and ticket us for a traffic violation and we will comply when asked to stop our car. We also know that police have an obligation to assist us if we require protection from harm and we know that the police will answer our calls for assistance.

5.	Laws Communicate Moral Standards -- The Ideological Function

This refers to the belief system and values that underlie the law. Law represents morality and laws can legitimize certain conduct or condemn other behavior. Laws are used to preserve the moral order of society.

Laws represent the collective will of the people and thus represent predominant social and moral values. Because of this, laws have a high degree of moral authority.

Laws thus have an educational, socialization, and legitimizing function and communicate society's moral values.

Because people respect the law, they condemn the behaviors that our laws prohibit.

Laws represent what society as a whole determines are proper forms of conduct. Laws define what is good and bad and in so doing, influence morality.

One of the arguments against the legalization of marijuana is that if you remove the criminal prohibition, the government will be condoning the behavior. The law prohibiting marijuana usage serves an educational and ideological function because it defines this behavior is wrong. This moral stance prevents many people from using marijuana.

Remove the legal stigma, critics argue, and you make the behavior acceptable and marijuana usage will increase.

## Critique and Dysfunctions in Law

Critics argue that the law can be used to justify and protect the status quo, prevent reforms and social change, and maintain inequities within society.

Laws can be discriminatory and promote injustice and inequality.

In many countries, laws are used as a weapon of oppression by those in power against the weak and powerless. This is one of the main critiques of law by conflict theorists. In totalitarian societies, laws are used to deny people rights and freedom and to intimidate people into submission and prevent social change.

Laws can also be complex and expensive to use and enforce. This means that the legal system may benefit those who are rich and powerful at the expense of poor and minority groups.

Laws may also be rigid and restrictive and lead to over-regulation in trade and commerce and restrain and paralyze merchants, farmers, etc.

## Mediation, Arbitration and Adjudication

Dispute or conflict resolution often involves the intervention of a third party and this can be done formally or informally.

### Mediation

Mediation is a non-adversarial technique in which a neutral their party is placed between the disputants in order to assist the parties to come to an agreement.

Mediation is non-coercive and mediators can only use persuasion to influence the final outcome.

The mediator does not impose a decision on the parties.

Mediation works best only if both parties are willing to work out a reasonable settlement of their dispute.

The underlying principle is cooperation rather than competition. The goal seek compromises and to ensure the mutual satisfaction of both parties.

Mediation typically is done in private (closed) but may in some case be open which allows the mediator to quote either party in his/her report.

The role of the mediator is that a facilitator and a guide.

Mediators are usually chosen because they have status, authority, and/or specialized knowledge.

Mediators typically attempt to settle the dispute in one of the two ways:

1.	By convincing the parties that it is their own interests to do so (interests based mediation).
2.	Rights-based mediation involves a mediator with specialized knowledge who gives the parties an initial assessment of their respective positions with regard to existing rules, regulations, and laws.

Canada's *Divorce Act* requires that lawyers mention the possibility of using mediation to their clients.

Research indicates that couples who use mitigation are less likely to go back to court, are more satisfied with the results, and have better relationships with ex-spouses.

### Arbitration

Arbitration also involves a third party in a dispute only in this case, the arbitrator can impose a solution on the combatants.

Arbitration allows the third party to make a final and binding decision.

Parties typically must agree beforehand that the arbitrator's decision will be final.

Arbitration is rights based and is often adversarial. Arbitration hearings are often held in the same manner as a civil trial but are typically held in private.

In arbitration, the emphasis is on the legal rights and duties of the parties. The goal is not to seek compromises or to ensure the mutual satisfaction of the parties.

Both mediation and arbitration are faster than a civil trail and usually reduce costs significantly.

### Adjudication

Adjudication is a public and formal method of resolving conflicts and is best illustrated by the court system.

Courts can intervene in a dispute, impose a decision on both parties, and has the authority to enforce the decision.

Courts require that disputes be narrowed down to the legally relevant facts and issues.

Courts will listen to both sides and will find a compromise decision if each has valid arguments. However, a court's decision may also leave a clear-cut winner and loser. It is much more of a zero sum game.

## Administrative Law and Regulatory Offences

Government is often described as having three branches: the (1) **legislative** branch includes the federal and provincial assemblies and create statutory laws; the (2) **judicial** branch consists of the courts and hear cases; and the (3) **executive** branch which consists of government departments and is responsible for implementing laws and social policies.

Government departments and agencies are established through legislation (statutory law) and run programs and perform other government business outside the court system. Their function is to implement government programs and ensure that they are run efficiently and fairly and according to law.

Typically these agencies have the power to develop policies, implement these policies, regulate themselves, and hear and resolve conflicts with citizens. Violations of administrative law are sometimes referred to as **regulatory offences**.

### True Crimes vs. Regulatory Offences

Some authors make a distinction between what they call true crimes and regulatory offences. True crimes are behaviors that are considered to be inherently wrong and harmful by the majority of the population. These include predatory crimes such as robbery and murder and to a lesser degree, consensual crimes such as illicit drug usage or sales (thought to me morally wrong).

Regulatory offences, on the other hand, are meant to control activities that are considered lawful such as business, trade, transportation, and various activities related to industrial production, sales, and service.

The objective of regulatory offences is to protect the public and societal interests from possible harm resulting from careless or unscrupulous actions taken by business, industry, etc. These statutes set minimum standards of conduct and care and are meant to regulate and prevent harm to the public.

Regulatory offences can be Federal, Provincial, or municipal and deal with such diverse matters as false or misleading advertising, the production of dangerous products, regulations regarding the handling and packaging of food products, pollution controls, safety issues in the workplace, standards for weights and measures, the control of natural resources such as fish stocks for forests, etc.

Regulatory measures and statutes are the primary mechanisms by which government guides and implements public policy objectives. As such, it is difficult to think of anything that is not regulated for the benefit of Canadians as a whole and these regulations are thought to be absolutely essential for the smooth running of a complex society.

Generally speaking, regulatory offences are seen as less serious and less morally culpable than true crime. Criminal offences carry more severe penalties, greater social stigma, and a criminal record if convicted. Regulatory offences such as polluting a late are viewed as less orally wrong than robbery and are subject to less serious penalties.

The burden of proof for the Crown is less demanding for regulatory offences than for criminal offences. For criminal offences, the Crown must prove both the act and intent beyond a reasonable doubt. For regulatory offences, it is usually sufficient for the Crown to simply prove that the accused committed the prohibited act. If the Crown establishes that the act was committed, the accused must then prove on a valance of probabilities that he/she was not negligent. It is thus much easier for the Crown to obtain a conviction with regulatory offences.

### Administrative Tribunals

Although regulatory offences differ from true crime, there are nonetheless serious penalties attached to them and they are often referred to as **quasi-criminal statutes** and are said to exercise "quasi-judicial" powers.

Government employees regulate the programs for the citizens of Canada and do so according to the law (**rule of law**). Often, however, disputes arise which have to be resolved between citizens and these government agencies. Most departments have developed **administrative tribunals** that function to help resolve disputes.

The tribunals are created by federal, provincial or municipal governments and are called by various names including : boards, commissions, committees, councils, tribunals, or agencies. Provincial examples include: the Human Rights Commission, the Children's Aid Society, the Landlord and Tenant Board, the Workman's Compensation and the Health and Safety Council. Examples of federal government tribunals include the National Parole Board, the Immigration and Refugee Appeal Board, and the RCMP Complaints Commission. Other tribunals include marketing boards, social welfare agencies, and government agencies from National Revenue to Education.

Each of these tribunals has specific jurisdictions and their authority comes from laws (statutes) in which the government **delegates** certain powers to government agencies. These agencies or tribunals can set standards and regulations that persons or corporations are required to follow. These bodies often have significant powers and can levy fines, send people back to prison, de-certify professionals, revoke licenses, fire people, deport them out of the country, and impose a wide variety of punishments.

Administrative tribunals are established to provide an impartial body that is intended to ensure that the government's authority is exercised in a fair and non-discriminatory way. Some of these tribunals also deal with conflicts between citizens such as in the case of landlord and tenant disputes.

Typically, members of these tribunals have specialized knowledge, training, education, and/or experience. Ideally, the tribunals should have autonomy from the department and not be unduly influenced by authorities.

Their job is to hear complaints/grievances by citizens against government departments and resolve these conflicts according to certain principles and consistent with the law. The conflict is sometimes regarded as a contest between government interests and those of individual citizens and the tribunal decides  whose interests will prevail.

One common **critique** of these boards is the fact that members are also representatives of the organizations and subject to a conflict of interests. Members, for example, may feel that it is their duty to uphold the policies or reputation of the department (who pays their salaries and promotes them) against the needs or rights of individuals. (E.g., police tribunals consist of higher-ranking officers sitting in judgement of lower ranking officers who may face charges under the *Police Act*).

Administrative tribunals cannot act arbitrarily but instead base their decisions with reference to relevant regulations and legislation. The issue here refers to authority  based on questions of **jurisdiction**. Jurisdiction refers to the authority of a body to make decisions or take action with reference to certain specific areas of control - e.g., the right of the National Parole Board to award or deny parole to an inmate.

Despite the powers given to these tribunals, citizens still have recourse to the courts if they feel that they have been treated unjustly. The courts maintain a supervisory role and will overrule a tribunal if there has been some violation of due process or if the judgement is contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

One of the operational variables relevant to administrative tribunals is the issue of **due process** or **procedural fairness**. This means that the procedures followed are relevant, lawful, fair, and impartial. In addition, the complainant has the right to be given relevant information, representation, and the opportunity and participate.

Tribunals are not governed by the strict procedurals or rules of evidence that the courts must follow. Most tribunals combine both formal and informal characteristics in their hearings and members are allowed to degree of **discretion** in making decisions. Members are also allowed to use their **expertise**. Cost and efficiency are often considerations in moving cases through the system.

### Advantages of administrative tribunals include:

1.	They offer a mechanism to ensure that individual rights are respected by government officials.
2.	They are faster, more efficient and less costly than the formal court process.
3.	Members of tribunals are often appointed because of their expertise and can bring their knowledge and experience to bear in making decisions.
4.	The process is less formal and can make use of a wide variety of evidence that is relevant to the issue.
5.	The tribunals must respect citizens rights and act according to due process - i.e., they must provide a fair and impartial hearing.
6.	The waiting time before a case can be heard is much shorter than a court case. The hearing is often straightforward and easily understood by participants.
7.	Generally the decision-making process is open to public scrutiny and can be appealed through courts.

Administrative law is pervasive and deals with significant issues. These tribunals make decisions that are highly important to ordinary citizens. Not only that, they are the most pervasive symbols of how fairly the state treats its' citizens in a democratic society.
