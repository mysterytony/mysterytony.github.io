# Module 7: Contracts and Contract Law -- Principles Underlying Criminal Law and Civil Law

## Basic Principles Underlying Contract Law

### Definition of a contract

A contract may be defined as an agreement between two or more parties that is binding in law. This means that the contract generates rights and obligations that may be enforced by the courts. The normal method of enforcement is an action for financial damages for breach of contract, though in some cases the court may compel performance by the party in default.

**Bilateral Contracts** involve promises by each party whereas **unilateral contracts** involve one party promising to do something in exchange for an act of the other party. Offering an award is an example of a unilateral contract.

Basic principles of contracts include the following:

1. Contracts are always about commercial relationships.
2. Courts assume that you mean what you say and they are not interested in second guessing you.
3. If it looks like an agreement, it almost always is one.
4. Courts are generally not concerned about the fairness of a contract.
5. Written contracts carry great weight.
6. We often have little control over the content of most contracts.

### (1) Damages

Where a contract has been **breached** there are several possible remedies. The most common is monetary compensation or damages. A claim for *quantum meruit* is a claim for reasonable remuneration. "As much as he/she deserves."

Any unusual or unexpected losses (e.g., remoteness of damage) that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the breaching party at the time of the agreement was entered into will not be included in an award of damages. Damages may be adjusted if the plaintiff fails to limit losses. This would occur in the case of **contributory negligence**.

### (2) Injunction

An injunction can be used to make a person stop what he/she is doing if it is inconsistent with the terms of the contract.

### (3) Specific Performance

Courts may also order the breaching party to finish the work under the contract and this is known as specific performance.

There are three ingredients to a contract:

1. The parties must reach an agreement or consensus -- offer and acceptance.
2. They must intend to be legally bound.
3. Both parties must provide valuable consideration.

Certain people in society are **vulnerable** and are therefore in need of special protection. Thus, their freedom to bargain and enter into legally binding contracts has been limited or completely eliminated.

The use of duress or **undue influence** is considered wrongful conduct and may affect the validity of the contract. Duress involves making threats of violence, imprisonment, blackmail, etc. to force someone to enter into an agreement. Undue influence often occurs in situations in which one person has power over another or is in a position of higher authority and/or a position of trust.

**Terms of the Contract**: contracts consist of various statements, promises, and stipulations. There are called the terms of the contract.

**Misrepresentations**: a misrepresentation is a false statement of fact that includes a person to enter into a contract that he/she would otherwise not enter. The seller cannot actively mislead or provide false information or this will be considered as misrepresentation and may void the contract.

**Exclusion Clauses**: an exclusion clause inserted into a contract aims to exclude (or financially limit) one party's liability for breach of contract, misrepresentation, or negligence.

**Discharging the Contract**: a contractual relationship can be brought to an end in four different ways: performance, agreement, frustration, and breach.

**The Corporation** exists under an act of parliament. It is a legal entity separate from the owner. If corporation go bankrupt, you cannot get money from the CEO, shareholders, or the Broad of Directors.

## Basic Principles Underlying Criminal Law and Civil Law

### Criminal Law

Under the criminal law, crime is defined as an offence against the public as represented by the government. Offences in criminal courts are prosecuted by the Crown Attorney who represents the Queen. The charge is read as Regina vs. Smith with Regina referring to the Queen and Smith being the defendant. The *Criminal Code* is a Federal statute.

Criminal law's main goal in punitive. By punishing people who break the law, the criminal justice system aims to deter others from crime and to protect society. Serious criminal offences are punished by terms of imprisonment.

Deterrence theory is based on the assumption that society can maintain social order and control people through fear. Retribution, denunciation, and rehabilitation are other principles of sentencing.

Value consensus theory suggests that society has shared values and definitions of right and wrong. The prohibitions found in the Criminal Code of Canada are thus similar to those found in other countries throughout the world.

Criminal acts are viewed as the most serious breaches of society's laws, are condemned as wrong, immoral, and a threat to social order, and are viewed as deserving of society's condemnation and harsh response.

The criminal law is meant to apply to all citizens who are equal in the eyes of the law.

This means that the law should be applied fairly and impartially without favour to some or prejudice to others. The phrase "the rule of law" illustrates these values.

Other principles include the following:

Laws must be enacted and on the books. If it is not a law passed by government, then the behaviour is not an offence.

Laws must be clear. People must be able to determine exactly what is prohibited and what is not.

A criminal offence consists of the act (*actus reus*) and the intent (*mens rea*). The Crown attorney must prove that the accused committed the act with the requisite intent and is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt whereas the defence attorney only has to raise a reasonable doubt in order to gain an acquittal.

Citizens have a variety of rights under the *Canadian Charter of Individual Rights and Freedoms**. Criminal law must be administered according to the values underlying a due process model and be consistent with the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms*. Courts will typically disallow evidence obtained illegally or in violations of an individual's rights.

Principles articulated in the *Criminal Code of Canada* direct officials of the criminal justice system including judges to use the least coercive methods possible in dealing with offenders consistent with the protection of society.

Criminal trials typically allow the victim little involvement and limits his/her role to that of a witness -- a passive vs. an active role.

Criminal laws are highly symbolic since they represent society's view of behaviour that is a violation of important values, morally wrong, and harmful to individuals and society. Criminal convictions represent a moral condemnation by society.

Criminal convictions carry a heavy stigma since the offender is viewed as having done something serious, harmful, and morally wrong. The stigma may adversely affect a person's ability to reintegrate into society. Offenders may have difficulty finding employment with a criminal record.

Criminal law attributes personal responsibility for the crime and holds individuals accountable for their actions.

Criminal law is highly punitive and can impose limits on one's freedoms. These include sentences of incarceration, or conditional sentences that impose curfews, community service, and involvement in programs such as anger management. Prohibitions from using alcohol, associating with other persons, taking on debts, getting married, restrictions on where one can live, etc.

## Civil Law

Civil law deals with situations in which one person (the plaintiff) sues another (the defendant) for damages as the result of an injury caused to the former by the latter. Most laws relating to torts and contracts are provincial.

Civil law can attributes either individual responsibility or collective responsibility for the crime. A plaintiff can sue an individual, corporation, or the government.

There may be some stigma attached to civil suits but in most instances, there is very little. It is seen as a contractual dispute and does not require moral turpitude.

Civil law is designed to compensate victims for their injuries at the hands of another. The civil law aims to redress personal injuries. Civil law deals with injuries that are defined as torts or occur because of the non-fulfillment of a contract.

Torts refer to issues, losses, and injuries that arise in the absence of a contract and that result from harmful or negligent behaviour on the part of the defendant.

Contracts refer to written or verbal agreements in which one party agrees to supply goods and/or services in exchange for payment or something else of value.

### Five Proofs in Torts

1. Duty of care
2. Fault of breach
3. Damages/loss/or injury
4. Causation/negligence
5. Contribution of the victim/plaintiff negligence and responsibilities

### Contracts must have several elements of be valid

1. An agreement in which there is an offer and an acceptance
2. Consideration in which both parties receive a benefit (give and gain)
3. Intention and capacity to understand the agreement
4. Legality (you cannot contract illegal activities)
5. Discharge or completion

The burden of proof in civil matters is significantly less than criminal law and requires only the plaintiff establish fault based on **the balance of probabilities**.

Civil law is also meant to be impartial and threat both parties without favour or prejudice. People are also equal before the law in civil matters.

Civil cases are typically heard by judge alone but jury trials are allowed in cases involving personal injury. Prison sentences are not allowed under civil law. Debtor prisons were abolished in the past century.

If the defendant is found to be at fault in a civil matter, judges can make three types of rulings:

1. the defendant must pay some or all of the damages claimed by the plaintiff
2. the defendant must provide the goods or services claimed by the plaintiff
3. the judge may prohibit the defendant from continuing in certain activities (e.g., producing goods for which they do not hold a patent or licence; advertise using another person's song or image; trespassing on someone's property).

**Negligence** is a principle in both cases and civil cases (particularly torts). Both the act and intent must be present in the case of negligence. A wrongful act can be both criminal and result in civil proceedings against the defendant.

The victim plays an active role in civil matters since they are also the client/plaintiff and can place demands on their attorney.

In contract matters, the court attempts to determine the intention of the parties when they entered into the contract. The court generally does not concern itself with the fairness of the bargain that was struck.

Unlike criminal law, contracts are often verbal and may be vague and unclear to the parties. This is one reason why disputes arise in the first place.
