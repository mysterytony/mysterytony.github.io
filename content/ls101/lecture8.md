# Module 8: Principles of the Criminal Law

## The Criminal Law and the *Criminal Code of Canada*

The *Criminal Code of Canada (C.C.C.)* is a Federal Statute that applies uniformly throughout Canada.

One can only obtain a criminal record by violating certain Federal offences including the *Criminal Code*, the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* and the *Crimes Against Humanity* and the *War Crimes Act*.

We also have juvenile legislation entitled the *Youth Criminal Justice Act* that deals with criminal offences committed by young persons age 12 to 17. Youth offenders are dealt with in Youth Court and once a person becomes 18, he/she is treated as an adult and dealt with in adult court. A person who commits a crime at age 17 but who is now 18 at the time of trial will still be treated as a youth and tried in youth court.

There are provisions in the *Youth Criminal Justice Act* for the transfer of youthful offender to adult court for trial for serious criminal charges.

Certain offences can be committed outside the country including treason, genocide, terrorist offences, and child sexual abuse.

## Summary Conviction Offences

Summary conviction offences are less serious offences punishable by a maximum of six months in prison plus the possibility of a fine not exceeding $2000. Summary conviction offences are tried before a provincial/territorial court judge. The term summary is used to indicate that these offences are tried rapidly and without complex procedures.

Examples of summary conviction offences include theft under $5000, taking an automobile or vessel without consent, and causing a disturbance in a public place.

Some offences are hybrid or **dual offences** meaning they may be tried as either a summary or an indictable offence.

The United States use the terms felony to refer to more serious offences and misdemeanor to refer to less serious criminal offences.

## Indictable Offences

Indictable offences are more serious crimes punishable by imprisonment. Most of the offences in the *Criminal Code* are indictable crimes. The term originates from the use of an indictment, which is a formal document that sets out the charges that the accused person is alleged to have committed.

In most cases, a person charged with an indictable offence may elect to be tried by a provincial court judge, a superior judge sitting alone or with a jury. Very serious offences such as murder are tried by a superior court judge sitting with a jury.

In most cases, persons charged with an indictable offence can elect a preliminary hearing before a provincial judge to decide whether or not there is sufficient evidence to proceed to a trial.

Indictable offences have five categories of seriousness indicated by the length of prison sentence available. These categories include two years, five years, 10 years, 14 years, and life.

Most prison sentences listed in the *Criminal Code* are maximum sentences and there are few minimum sentences (e.g., first degree murder has a minimum life sentence with parole eligibility set at 25 years).

Criminal Offences Fall into Three General Categories:

1. Offences against public order and the good of the state
2. Offences against the person: physically or his/her reputation
3. Offences of a financial nature or against property

## 1. Offences against public order or the good of the state

## Sec. 46 Treason

Treason includes attempts to assassinate the Queen, waging war against Canada, and using force in attempting to overthrow the government.

## Sec. 83 Terrorism

Terrorism related offences were added to the *Criminal Code* only after 9/11 and are punishable by up to life imprisonment.

Misleading Justice offences include:

## Sec. 131 Perjury

Perjury refers to giving false testimony under oath and is punishable by up to ten years in prison.

## Sec. 137 Fabricating evidence

is punishable by up 14 years

## Sec. 140 Public Mischief

Public Mischief is a summary conviction offence and includes behaviors such as falsely reporting a crime, bomb scares or threats, laying false accusations, or otherwise deliberately misleading authorities.

## Sec. 174 Nudity

174 (1) Every one who, without lawful excuse, (a) is nude in a public place, (b) is nude and exposed to public view while on private property, whether or not the property is his own, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

(2) For the purpose of this section, a person is nude who is so clad as to offend against public decency or order.

(3) No proceeding shall be commenced under this section without the consent of the Attorney general.

This law prohibits nudity in a public place or in a place, which in exposed to the public even if the person is on private property.

Nudity also includes being clothed so as to offend against public decency or order. A women who wears a transparent blouse could be charged under this section even though she is clothed in the literal sense of the word.

Public decency refers to acceptable Canadian standards of tolerance. It is left to the trial judge to determine if the nudity or the manner of dress offends public decency.

Nudity in a performance is usually not prosecuted since this is regarded as a lawful excuse for nudity.

## Sec. 173 Indecent Act

Sec 173 (1) of the criminal code states:

Every one who willfully commits an indecent at (a) in a public place in the presence of one or more persons, or (b) in any place with intent thereby to insult or offend any person, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

This section makes it an offence to engage in indecents acts or to expose oneself in certain circumstances.

Public place includes any place to which the public has access as of right or by invitation express or implied. Courts have ruled that if the place is one in which the public could witness the acts, then it is public. It is no defence that the accused did not know that the acts could be seen by others.

Having sex in a parked car may or may not constitute a public place. It depends where the car is parked. In *R. vs. Sloan*, the courts held that since the car was parked late at night at the dge of a parking lot away from all other cards and where the sexual activity could only be seen by someone approaching the vehicle and looking inside, it did not constitute a public place. The couple was acquitted of an indecent act.

## Is giving someone the finger an indecent act?

Giving someone the finger may be considered an indecent act since the courts have ruled that an indecent act need not have sexual context. All that is required is an act that offends community standards of decency and is committed with the intention of insulting or offending another person.

## Is mooning something an indecent act?

The courts have ruled that if the accused intended their actions as a joke, the requisite intent was not present. If students mooned their friends as a joke, they would like be acquitted of an indecent act since the behaviour was not committed with malice.

## *R. vs. Jacobs (1996)* 112 C.C.C (3d) 1, 142 D.L.R. (4th) 411 (Ont. C.A.).

Gwen Jacobs, a University of Guelph student, challenged the law that prohibits women from exposing their breasts by walking down the main street of Guelph challenging the police to charge her.

She was acquitted of the charge of committing an indecent act. The Courts ruled that her actions did not violate community standards of intolerance, which is the test of indecency.

## Causing Disturbance (C.C. 175) (Disturbing the peace)

Everyone who not being in a dwelling-house, causes a disturbance in or near a public place (i) by fighting, shouting, swearing, singing or using insulting or obscene language; (ii) by being drunk; (iii) by impeding or molesting other persons in guilty of a summary conviction offence.

This section includes obstructing people; disturbing the peace of persons in a dwelling house; and disorderly conduct.

### (2) Offences Against the Person

include such crimes as murder, manslaughter, assault, sexual assault, kidnapping, forcible abduction, robbery, etc.

Offences against a person's reputation such as slander are also included under this category.

### (3) Offences Against Property (or of a Financial Nature)

This category includes: causing malicious damages; arson; forgery; counterfeiting; theft; extortion; embezzlement; fraud; break and enter, etc.

The vast majority of criminal charges and convictions in Canada are for offences against property.

## Accessories to a Criminal Offence

An accessory to an act is also liable to criminal prosecution since they commit and illegal act with a criminal intent. A person can be an accessory before the act, during the act, or after the act.

If someone counsels, procures, or incites another person to commit an offence, they can be found guilty of being an accessory before the fact and are punishable to the same degree.

If someone aids and abets the offender while they commit the act, they can be found guilty of being an accessory during the act and are also punishable to same degree (e.g., acting as a lookout during a robbery).

## Sec. 23 Accessory after the fact

An accessory after the fact to an offence is one who, knowing that a person has been a party to the offence, receives, comforts or assists that person for the purpose of enabling that person to escape.

The law used to exclude spouses from being an accessory after the fact but a spouse is no longer an exception (Sec 23.2 has been repealed).

The punishment for being an accessory after the fact is typically one-half the sentence for which the accused is liable or 14 years in case where the maximum sentence is life. For murder, the penalty is life imprisonment.

Sec. 240: "Everyone who is an accessory after the fact to murder is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

There was a celebrate English case in the 1950's. Chris was a juvenile at the time of the offence while Bentley was over 18. They were caught breaking into a building and Bentley was grabbed by a police officer. Bentley called out to Chris who was armed, "Let him have it Chris." Chris shot and killed the officer.

Bentley was charged with being an accessory to murder. At trial, Bentley contended that he was simply asking Chris to hand over the gun. The Crown argued that his words had a more sinister meaning. The jury convicted Bentley as an accessory to murder and he was later hanged for the crime. Chris was tried as a juvenile even though he did the shooting.

## The Criminal Law -- Underlying Principles and Defences

Act <---> Intent

Actus Reus <---> Mens Rea

There are two elements to an offence: the act (*actus reus*) and the intent (*mens rea*). *Actus reus* refers to the prohibited harm and can be an act or an omission and which must be voluntary. *Mens rea* deals with the person's state of mind when he/she committed the offence and refers to the guilty mind.

## Proving Causation

The Crown must prove that the accused committed the act and did so with criminal intent. An essential element of the *actus reus* of an offence is proving that the defendant's behavior actually caused the consequences. Factual causation is established if the Crown can prove that "but for" the accused's conduct, the prohibited consequences would not have occurred. In this way, the Crown shows that there is a causal link between the behavior and the harm.

## Voluntariness

One of the fundamental principles of the criminal law is that a person's conduct must be voluntary to be convicted of a criminal offences.

This means that the act must be one which a person is physically capable of doing and that the accused acted of his/her own free will.

An act or omission is not voluntary if it is a reflex or convulsion or bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep (see the defence of automatism discussed later).

## Presumption of Fact

It is very difficult to determine what goes on in a person's mind when they commit an act. This makes *mens rea* difficult to prove. The way around this for the courts is to assume that people are rational and that they can foresee the natural consequences of their actions. If they can foresee the consequences and yet they still act, it is presumed that they intended the consequences and have the requiste *mens rea*.

Ony way of determining this through the use of the "reasonable person" test. This requires that the judge or jury put themselves in the accused person's place and subjectively ask questions such as: "What would a reasonable or prudent person have done under the circumstances?" Or "What would a reasonable person have foreseen and intended from their actions?"

It is a common law presumption that people must have intended the natural and probable consequences of their actions.

Courts are free to draw the inference that one intends the consequences when one acts. The law states that the jury may draw that inference but are not required to. The accused may be able to explain their actions and the courts are free to believe him/her and acquit.

The Crown must prove that *actus reus* and *mens rea* occurred simultaneously.

## Case Example -- Does the act and intent occur simultaneously?

Dan is parking his car on a city street. Constable Vickers is guiding him into the space. One of the rear wheel of Dan's car comes to rest on the constable's foot. At that moment, the car engine stops but the evidence does not make it clear whether this was because the engine stalled or because Dan switched off the ignition. Vickers pointed out to Dan that the wheel was on his foot. Dan made an offensive remark and told the constable he could wait. Vickers made further requests and finally Dan moved the car. Dan was charged with assaulting a police officer in the execution of this duty.

## Why should there be any question of Dan's guilt?

Dan's lawyer argued that, when the car well came to rest on the constable's food, Dan performed the *actus reus* of an offence of assault but at the time he had to *mens rea*.

When he had the *mens rea*, that is, when he finally decided to leave the wheel on the foot, he was not committing any *actus reus*.

The defence contended that there was no coincidence of *mens rea* and *actus reus* -- they did not occur simultaneously.

The defence further argued that criminal liability would have been more feasible if Dan's foot had been squashing the policeman's foot because that would have required a continuing willed pressure.

The court did not accept this defence and convicted Dan on the basis that the *actus reus* was a failure to act or omission. When Dan decided that he would not immediately accede to the policeman request and move the car, he committed both the act and the *mens rea* as well. His refusal to move the car constituted both the *actus reus* and the *mens rea*.

## *Regina vs Ladue* -- It there *mens rea*?

Ladue visited Veronica's apartment where he found her on the couch in a state which Ladue took to be asleep. He had sexual relations with Veronica who, at the time, was in fact dead. Ladue was charged, under section 1832 of the *Criminal Code* with offering an indignity to a human corpse. His defence was that he was so drunk that he did not know Veronica was dead. In this own defence, he tried to explain his behavior by saying that the dead woman was a drug addict and was often found in a comatose state.

## Should Ladue be convicted?

Ladue argued that he could not be convicted because he had no intent to commit an indignity to a corpse under section 178 because he thought that Veronica was alive.

The British Columbia Court of Appeal did not accept the submission and convicted Ladue. The court ruled that if Ladue's contention was accepted, that would mean he was attempting to commit rape and he could not use a defence which was, in effect, an admission of another offence.

The Ladue case also raises the defence of mistake of fact which is discussed later.

## Forms of Intent -- Intentionality

The criminal law and criminal courts recognize various degrees of intent. The most serious form of *mens rea* known as "intentionality" involve cases in which a person commits a criminal at knowing that it is wrong and with an intention to do so and an intention to cause the consequences.

The person foresees and intends the consequences. He/She acted with forethought and with malice and a high degree of premeditation. First degree murder which is planned, premeditated, and deliberate is an example of intentionality.

This is the highest degree of culpability and will result in a conviction for the most serious form of a crime (e.g., first degree murder rather than second degree murder ro manslaughter) and the most serious sentence.

## Forms of Intent -- Recklessness as a form of *Mens rea*

Both the common law and the *Criminal Code* accept recklessness as a form of criminal intent. Recklessness id defined as total indifference to the consequence of an act. In these situations, the accused knowingly takes a deliberate and inexcusable risk and is thus reckless as to the consequences of his/her actions.

If, for example, Smith fires a high powered rifle through the wall of his apartment and kills his neighbor, in the adjoining apartment, the courts will likely find him guilty of culpable homicide even though he may not have intended to kill anyone. The fact that he acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others is itself a form of *mens rea*. He would likely be found guilty of second degree murder rather than first degree murder.

In these cases, the reasonable person test is used to determine what a reasonable person acting prudently would have foreseen. Clearly a reasonable person could easily foresee the danger in firing a rifle through an apartment wall. To foresee the consequences -- possibly killing some one -- and to take the risk is reckless behavior and a form of *mens rea*.

Section 429 of the *Criminal Code* explicitly includes recklessness a form of *mens rea*.

## Willfully Causing Event to Occur

Section 429 (1) Every one who causes the occurrence of an event by doing an act or by omitting to do an act that is his duty to do, knowing that the act or omission will probably cause the occurrence of the event and being reckless whether the event occurs or not, shall be deemed, for the purpose of this part, willfully to have caused the occurrence of the event.

Section 229 of the Criminal Code includes recklessness in its definition of homicide.

Sec. 229 Culpable homicide is murder where the person who causes the death of a human being

1. means to cause his death, or
2. means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not.

Recklessness is a lesser form of intent and in the case of murder, the accused would like be charged with second degree murder but not first degree murder. Because the person is judged to have foresight of his/her actions and realizes the risk, there exists a high degree of culpability.

Section 433 of the Criminal Code dealing with arson also makes reference to recklessness as a form of intent.

## Sec. 433 Arson

Section 433. Every person who intentionally or recklessly causes damage by fire or explosion to property, whether or not that person owns the property, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life where

1. the person knows that or is reckless with respect to whether the property is inhabited or occupied; or
2. the first or explosion causes bodily harm to another person.

Punishable by up to life imprisonment.

## Forms of Intent - Sec. 219 Criminal Negligence

Negligence is a less serious form of intent than recklessness and refers to indifferent to the consequences of an act. It implies inadvertence and means that a person was not thing when he/she should have been thinking (unlike the case of recklessness in which you were thinking but took the risk anyway).

Sec. 219 (1) Every one is criminally negligent who (a) in doing anything, or (b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.

Duty means duty imposed by law. Criminal negligence can arise through acts or omissions if the accused was under a legal duty of act. Thus for example, Section 215 of the Criminal Code requires that parents and guardians have a duty to provide the necessities of life to dependent children.

Section 220 includes the offence of causing death by criminal negligence and Section 221 makes it an offence to cause bodily harm by criminal negligence.

## Sec. 220 Causing Death by Criminal Negligence

Every one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

## Sec 221 Causing Bodily Harm by Criminal Negligence

Every one who by criminal negligence causes bodily harm to another person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.

The offence of manslaughter may be committed where the accused causes the death of his/her victim as a consequence of criminal negligence (sec. 222 (5) and 234 of the Criminal Code).

## Offences of Absolute and Strict Liability -- Regulatory Offences

Historically, regulatory offences were considered offences of absolute liability and the Crown only had to prove the *actus reus* element of the offence. The courts generally did not accept any defences to the offence and defendant could not argue they were not to blame.

In recent years, the courts have moved away from this position and begun to allow certain defences to regulatory offences. In *R. vs. Sault Ste. Marie* (1978), for example, the city was convicted of pollution offences when it was shown that garbage it had entrusted to a private company was dumped on a site where chemicals leaked into a water table.

The city was convicted but the conviction was later overturned and the city was allowed to use **the defence of due diligence** and argue that it had taken reasonable precautions and was not guilty of the offence.

The lower court viewed the offence as one of absolute liability whereas the court of appeal defined it as one of strict liability in which the defence of due diligence could be used.

In *R. vs. Sault Ste. Marie* (1987), the court distinguished between three categories of criminal offences in Canada:

1. Real crimes in which the Crown must prove both *actus reus* and *mens rea*.
2. Offences of strict liability in which the Crown only has to prove the actus reus but where defendants can avoid liability by proving they acted with due diligence.
3. Offences of absolute liability in which the Crown only has to prove actus reus and the defence of due diligence is not open to the accused.

This ruling means that offence of absolute liability requires no mens rea and that no defences are available to the accused: simply doing the act will result in a conviction. Similarly, with offences of strict liability, the Crown does not have to prove mens rea, however, certain defences are available. The due diligence defence requires that the accused prove that he/she took reasonable care before proceeding (e.g., checking a person's I.D. before selling him/her cigarettes to ensure he/she is not a minor).

## Possession of Break-In Instruments

351 (1) Every one who, without lawful excuse, the proof which lies on him, has in his possession any instrument suitable for the purpose of breaking into any place, motor vehicle, vault, or safe under circumstances that give rise to reasonable inference that the instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used for any such purpose, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.

This section of the Criminal Code requires that the Crown establish that the accused had in his/her possession tools suitable for the purpose of breaking into houses. There is no need to prove that the accused intended to use them to commit a burglary. Intent is presumed from the possession.

This section is an offence of strict liability because the law provides a possible defence to the accused and makes it clear if a person can establish a lawful excuse for possessing burglary tools, he/she can win an acquittal. However, the onus is on the accused to prove he/she had the instruments for a legal purpose.

A carpenter contracted to do some work for a homeowner has a lawful excuse for showing up the house with his/her tools. A man found lurking around a home with a crowbar in the middle of the night may have difficulty proving that the tool was to be used for lawful purposes.

## Care and Control of a Motor Vehicle

Section 253 of the Criminal Code makes it an offence to be in the "care or control" of a motor vehicle when one's ability to drive a motor vehicle has been impaired by alcohol or drugs or while one's blood is above 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood (referred to as 0.08).

This offence does not require the Crown to prove that the accused was driving, attempting to drive, or had an intent to drive the vehicle. Simply proving the actus reus (i.e., the person had care and control of the vehicle) is sufficient to convict.

The Crown must prove two elements of the offence: namely that (1) the person was impaired or above the .08 level; and (2) that he/she had care or control of the vehicle. The crown does not have to prove the person intended to drive.

Courts have interpreted the "care or control" provision liberally and it often means having the keys in one's possession. In *R. v Pilon* (1998) the accused was found guilty of this offence after the police found him drunk and asleep in his truck. Pilon testified  that he had no intent to drive, was just sleeping off his state of intoxication, and had tossed his keys under the passenger's seat. The court ruled, however, that iw was a simple matter for him to pick up the keys and he was therefore in "care or control" of the vehicle. He was convicted and the conviction was upheld on appeal.

On the other hand, the Supreme Court ruled that in *R. vs Toews* that the accused was not in care or control of the vehicle even though he was discovered intoxicated and asleep in his truck. The evidence indicated that the truck was on private property, the accused had been driven to the property from a party by a friend, he was waiting to be picked up by a friend, and he was asleep in a sleeping bag.

Because an act must be voluntary, the courts would acquit an extremely intoxicated person who was placed unconscious in a car by his/her friends because his/her entry into the vehicle was not voluntary.

## Wearing a Disguise

Sec. 351 (2) Every one who, with intent to commit an indictable offence, has his face masked or colored or is otherwise disguised is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.

In this section, the onus is on the Crown to prove that the accused intended to commit an indictable offence. Therefore, it is not an offence of strict liability.

## Justifications for Offences of Strict Liability

Even though certain sections of the Criminal Code allow Courts to convict someone of a criminal offence without having an intent to commit a prohibited act, and justification comes from the fact that the earlier behavior of the accused was culpable and voluntary and included a guilty mind.

Burglars, for examples, arm themselves with housebreaking tools with a criminal intent to steal. Similarly, impaired drivers consume alcohol with the knowledge that their ability to drive may be impaired before they enter a vehicle.

Generally speaking, the courts are likely to rule that a statute is one of strict liability unless the wording clearly indicates that the legislature wanted it to be one of absolute liability. In addition, several offences of absolute liability have been struck down by courts who viewed them as a violation of Charter rights. It can now be said that there are no offences of absolute liability in the Criminal Code and only a few offences of strict liability.

## Public Welfare Statute: Offences of Strict and Absolute Liability

Most offences of strict or absolute liability are found in public welfare statutes. These types of statutes have proliferated in the 20th and 21st centuries and include Government regulations dealing with such diverse activities as the handling of food and drugs, speed limits on highways, and other driving infractions, pollution, immigration, registration of pets, landlord and tenant disputes, construction, employment and unionization, zoning and building inspections, etc.

These types of offences are not criminal but many scholars regard them as quasi-criminal since they often have serious penalties including the loss of licenses, fines, and possible imprisonment. The procedures in court are similar to criminal procedures with criminal rules of evidence and a Crown attorney who is charged with prosecuting the accused. These cases typically take place with a judge only.


Why do we have these statutes?

1. for public welfare -- the behaviors prohibited are in the public interest
2. for reasons of expediency -- there is no need to prove mens rea and the machinery of justice can move more quickly
3. the penalties are typically small and usually result in a fine
4. there is little stigma or loss of reputation

One of the main arguments in favor of offences of strict and absolute liability is that they provide incentives for companies and individuals to take care. Just the fact that there are no defences available (absolute liability) or that the onus is on them to prove due diligence (strict liability), they will take precautionary measures to an extraordinary degree to ensure they meet the requirements of the statutes.

Another argument in favor is that of administrative efficiency. Since the Crown may have to deal with many such cases (e.g., highway traffic offences, pollution, etc.), offences of absolute or strict liability provide pragmatic and efficient mechanisms for dealing with the regulation of trade, commerce, pollution, traffic, etc.

*R. vs Pierce Fisheries Ltd.* (1970)

The accused corporation had been charged under the Lobster Fisheries Regulations with having possession of any lobster of a length less than the specified minimum size. In a catch of more than fifty thousand pounds of lobsters, an inspector found 26 under-sized lobsters. The defendant company argued that no authorized officer or employee of Pierce Fisheries Ltd. had any knowledge that the undersized lobsters were on the company premises. The president of the company had instructed his employees not to buy undersized lobsters. Consequently, the accused contended that there should be an acquittal because there was no mens rea. The magistrate who tried the case and The Nova Scotia Appeal Court both thought the defendant should be acquitted. A majority of the Supreme Court thought otherwise and found the company guilty.

The Supreme court decided that this was an offence of strict liability because the Lobster Fishery Regulations were obviously intended for the purpose of protecting lobsters beds from depletion and thus conserving the source of supply for an important fishing industry which is of general public interest.

## Criticisms of Regulatory Statutes

Arguments against offences of absolute and strict liability include the belief that these types of statutes are fundamentally unjust because they punish people who have no mens rea or moral culpability. The objection is strongest with offences of absolute liability where no defences are admitted. Critics are also concerned that these types of statutes lead to form of administrative oppression and petty tyranny.
