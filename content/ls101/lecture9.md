# Module 9: Mental Disorder and the Law

## Introductory Comments

The history and treatment of the mentally disordered

The old *Mental Health Act*

*Parens patriae*

## The *Health Care Consent Act of Ontario* 1996

The Health Care Consent Act 1996 deals with the rights of patients within Ontario medical facilities including psychiatric institutions. The focus of this Act is on patient rights specifically as they relate to consent to treatment. The Act states:

**No treatment without consent**

10 (1) A health practitioner who proposes a treatment for a person shall not administer the treatment, and shall take reasonable steps to ensure that it is not administered unless:

(a) he or she is of the opinion that the person is capable with respect to the treatment, and the person has given consent; or

(b) he or she is of the opinion that the person is incapable with respect to the treatment, and the person's substitute decision-maker has given consent on the person's behalf in accordance with this Act.

The Act also has provisions for exceptions to the consent rules in the case of medical emergencies.

## Elements of consent

11 (1) The following are the elements required for consent to treatment:

1. The consent must relate to treatment
2. The consent must be informed
3. The consent must be given voluntarily
4. The consent must not be obtained by misrepresentation or fraud

## Consent and Capacity Board

The Consent and Capacity Board is an independent body created by the provincial government. It conducts hearings under the Health Care and Consent Act, and Mental Health Act, and the Substitute Decisions Act. Board members for psychiatric hearings usually consist of one psychiatrist, one lawyer, and a member of the general public.

Under the Mental Health Act, the Board will hold a hearing to deal with consent to treatment, involuntary status of patients, the appointment of a substitute decision maker, and finding aof incapacity to manage property. Either the patient or the health facility may ask for a hearing. The hearing will usually take place within a week of the application and the parties will be informed of the time and place of the hearing. The hearing will be held in the facility where the person who is the subject of the hearing resides or receives treatment.

Patients may attend the hearing and be represented by a lawyer, a right advisor, or others. Hospitals will also be represented and either party can invite people to attend, submit documents, call witnesses, ask questions, and present summary remarks. Board members will deliberate in private and will issue their decision immediately or within one day. Any of the parties may appeal the Board's decision to the General Division of the Ontario Court

## The *Mental Health Act of Ontario* 1990

The Mental Health Act of Ontario deals mainly with the rights of patients who are under observation, care, and treatment in a psychiatry facility.

## Criminal Code of Canada -- the Defence of Mental Disorder

The defence of mental disorder aims at the mens rea component of an offence by arguing that the person did not have the capacity to form a criminal intent because they suffered from a mental disorder at the time of the offence (actus reus) was committed.

The defence of mental disorder is found in Section 16 (1) of the Criminal Code of Canada and states:

## 16. Defence of Mental Disorder

(1) No person is criminally responsible for an act committed or an omission made while suffering from a mental disorder that rendered the person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.

(2) **Presumption** -- Every person is presumed not to suffer from a mental disorder so as to be exempt from criminal responsibility by virtue of subsection 1, until the contrary is proven on the balance of probabilities.

(3) **Burden of proof** -- The burden of proof that an accused was suffering from a mental disorder so as to be exempt from criminal responsibility is on the party that raises the issue.

"Mental disorder" means a disease of the mind.

"Appreciates the nature and quality of an act" means to appreciate the physical consequences of an act.

The defence lawyer has the option to raising the defence of mental disorder during the course of the trial or of waiting until there has been a finding of guilt. The prosecution can only raise the defence after the court has concluded the defendant was *otherwise guilty*.

The use of the defence requires that th accused person admits to the act but argues that he/she did not have the requisite mental capacity to form a criminal intent.

Knowing that something is wrong refers to whether a person knows that the act is "morally wrong".

## The M'Naghten Rules

The origins of this defence comes from British case law and is known as the M'Naghten rules. In this famous case, the accused Daniel M'Naghten shot and killed Edward Drummond who was the secretary to Sir Robert Peel. This occurred in 1843 and resulted in M'Naghten's acquittal based on evidence presented in court that he was "insane" at the time he committed the murder.

The jury verdict led to a public outcry and resulted in the House of Lords developing a set of "rules" that should be used in trials to determine whether or not a person is "insane" and not legally culpable. These rules became known as the M'Naghten rules and required that (a) a person has to be suffering from a disease of the mind of such a degree that (b) it renders him/her incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or (c) of knowing that is was wrong.

These rules lay down very narrow grounds for the use of the defence of mental disorder. This means that most people suffering from a mental disorder would not be able to use the defence because their cognitive abilities would like ly not be sufficiently impaired to renders them incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.

In 1991, the Federal Government amedned section 16 (1) and replaced the antiquated and stigmatizing term "insanity" with the more modern term "mental disorder". The abbreviation for the defence of mental disorder is NCRMD (not criminally responsible because of mental disorder). Cases are also referred to as NCR (not criminally responsible).

When this defence is raised, expert testimony is generally provided by psychiatrists or clinical psychologists. The psychiatrists must convince the court that the mental disorder is serious enough to render the accused incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong. The mental disorder is established with reference to the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV)* published by the American Psychiatric Association.

Because sanity is presumed, the defence must prove -- based on the balance of probabilities -- that the person suffers from mental disorder that renders them incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.

In cases in which the Crown wishes to challenge the defence of mental disorder, both the Crown and defence attorney will call their own expert psychiatrists to testify. It is not uncommon to see Crown and defence witnesses contradicting each other leaving it up to the judge or jury to decide who to believe.

Critics of the defence of mental disorder point out that it relies almost exclusively on cognitive factors (reasoning abilities) and excludes emotional factors. A person may understand what they are doing and know it is wrong yet be incapable of controlling their behavior. In such cases, they would still be convicted.

## The Disposition of NCRMD Cases


Prior to 1992, a person found not guilty because of "insanity" was sent to a secure psychiatric facility and kept there for an indefinite period subject to periodic review. The Supreme Court of Canada struck down this provision of the C.C. in *R. v. Swain* (1991) arguing that such automatic detention violated sections 7 and 9 of the Charter.

Consequently, Parliament amended the C.C. in 1992 and required that review boards be established in all provinces and territories. These tribunals have taken over decisions related to NCR accuse persons and are made up of a minimum of these persons. The Chair is typically a judge, a second member must be a psychiatrist, and the background of the third member of the board is not specified. In Ontario, the Board is referred to as the Ontario Review Board and deals only with criminal matters related to mental disorder.

The review board is allowed to choose between three dispositions for NCR accused persons: (1) an absolute discharge; (2) a conditional discharge; or (3) an order to hold the accused person in custody in a psychiatric facility.

In deciding the appropriate disposition, the review board is directed to consider (a) the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, (b) the mental condition of the accused, (c) the reintegration of the accused into society; and (d) other needs of the accused.

The review is also directed to select the disposition that is the least restrictive to the accused considering the protection of society. The courts have also ruled that unless the accused constitutes a significate threat to the safety of the public, the board is required to order an absolute discharge.

For the board to detain the accused in a psychiatric facility, he/she must pose a serious threat of harming someone and that threat must be of a criminal nature. A lesser threat of a nuisance nature is not sufficient in law to hold an NCR person in a psychiatric facility against his/her will.

If the person is released under a conditional discharge, the conditions imposed must also be the least restrictive possible considering the protection of society.

The law makes it clear that the dispositions of NCR persons are not meant to serve as punishments.

## Fitness to Stand Trial

This section of the criminal code is used when an accused person appears to be suffering from a mental disorder to an extent that they are judged to be unable to understand the court proceedings and assist in their defence.

**672.22 Presumption of fitness** -- An accused is presumed fit to stand trial unless the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit to srand trial.

**672.32 (1) Subsequent proceedings** -- A verdict of unfit to stand trial shall not prevent the accused from being tried subsequently where the accused becomes fit to stand trial.

**672.33 (1) Prim facie case to be made every two years** -- The court that has jurisdiction in respect of the offence charged against an accused who is found unfit to stand trial shall hold an inquiry, not later than two years after the verdict if rendered and every two years thereafter until the accused is acquitted pursuant to subsection (6) or tried, to decide whether sufficient evidence can be adduced at that time to put the accused on trial.
