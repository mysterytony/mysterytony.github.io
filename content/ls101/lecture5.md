# Module 5: A Brief Introduction to Canada's Legal History

## The British North America Act 1867 (Constitution Act) and the Canada Act 1982

The process of Confederation in which Canada became a country began in 1867 when the British Parliament passed the British North America Act (BNA) (now referred to as the Constitution Act). The act created two levels of government, the federal government of Canada and the provincial governments and conferred different powers on each of them -- often referred to as the "division of powers".

The *BNA* allowed the federal government to create a common currency, a criminal code, to create and control the military, and was also given powers over trade and commerce, immigration, and divorce among other matters.

Provincial governments were given control over education, marriage, and the health system, etc.

Although the provincial governments were given the powers to create and manage the court system, the federal government retained the right to create national courts and to appoint judges to the superior courts.

In 1931, the British government granted complete independence to most of its former colonies in the *Statute of Westminster, 1931.* Canada did not have its own constitution and the British government agreed that it would no longer pass laws in respect of Canada without the Canada's request. It nonetheless retained the constitutional power to do so.

Canada finally became a completely autonomous nation in 1982 when the British parliament, at Canada's request, passed the *Canada Act 1982*. The *Canada Act 1982* is the constitution upon which all government powers are based and prescribes the means by which the constitution can be changed, a guarantee of Aboriginal rights, and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.

Canada is a democratic country in which citizens elect representatives to the federal and provincial assemblies.

Both the federal and provincial government have three distinct branches: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. All three branches have their own roles, powers, and abilities to change, implement, and make law.

1. The Legislative Branch

  The Canadian system of government is inherited from the British parliamentary tradition and is based on the principle of parliamentary supremacy. This means that the legislative branch is the most powerful and can make any laws as long as they are consistent with the Canadian constitution.

  People who are unhappy with the laws that our politician pass have the power to vote for others who promise to change the laws we don't like and pass laws that we do like.

2. The Executive Branch

  The executive branch of government includes all government branches (the civil service) including all government agencies, boards, and commissions. Their powers are determined by legislation and they are empowered to run various government programs, implement and enforce the various laws passed by the legislative branch. Often their powers include the right to create rules and regulations, which have the force of law.

3. The Judicial Branch

  The judicial branch of government includes the courts and judges. The judiciary are expected to be concerned with the law and not with political matters. Judges are supposed to be neutral and impartial when hearing and adjudicating individual cases.

  Judges are also independent and free to make their decisions according to law and free of political interference. It is improper for politicians or others to attempt to influence a judge in making a decision on a legal matter.

  Even though the courts do not have a major role in making law, they play a significant role in interpreting the law. In addition, they have the power to strike down laws passed by a provincial or the federal government if the laws are judges to be unconstitutional and/or a violation of the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* found in the Constitution.

  The courts thus act as a check or balance to the powers of the legislature because judges define the limits the legislative powers through their judgements in individual cases.

  Historically, judges have been responsible for making most of our laws through the creation of the "common law".

## The Evolution of the Common Law

The common law evolved in Britain over several centuries and developed through the use of judges appointed by the King to deal with conflicts that arose among his subjects. Originally, judges would travel the countryside on circuit and stop in various towns and villages to hear and arbitrate cases.

These circuit judges did not have any written laws to guide them and were initially guided by local customs, traditions, religious values, and their own sense of fairness and proportionality. The judges were careful to argue that they did not make the law but simply enforced the law, as it had always been known in the land. The law was "common" because it reflected the traditions and customs of the common people as they had lived their lives.

Over time, judges began to make reference to previous decisions they had made to justify their judgements and this gave rise to the use of "precedents" in adjudicating cases of a similar nature. Eventually these decisions and the reasons for them were written down and gave rise to a body of law known as the common law. Included were various assumptions, principles, and accepted defence to criminal charges. With the use of published cases and decisions, judges could more easily follow precedents.

As the number of cases evolved and the law became more complex, a professional class of attorney-at-law emerged to advocate on behalf of clients. Knowledge of precedents became important because ordinary people, most of who couldn't read, could not participate in legal proceedings without assistance.

By the 19th century, the practice of following precedents had evolved into a relatively strict rule of law. Thus by a process of making decisions in case after case, guided over the centuries by the rule of following precedent, the early English judges created a body of civil and criminal law that applied to and was common to all the people of England.

In Canada, the federal and provincial governments have replaced common law offence with statutory laws. However, there are still many defences and other principles of justice that have as their basis the common law and its precedents.

## AN OVERVIEW OF THE COURT SYSTEM IN CANADA

Each province in Canada has established two levels of trial courts and a provincial court of appeal. The judges at the lowest level are appointed by the provincial government. The federal government appoints judges for the superior court, the provincial court of appeal, and the Supreme Court of Canada (which was itself established by the federal government).

There are three levels of courts in each province: inferior of provincial courts, superior courts, and the Provincial Court of Appeal.

## Provincial Inferior Courts

The provincial or territorial court systems are similar to one other and based on the English system of inferior and superior courts. Provincial inferior courts are called provincial courts and superior courts are called just that -- superior courts.

Judges in provincial courts are appointed and paid by the provinces.

Provincial courts typically have several divisions including a criminal division, a civil division, a family division, a youth division, and a traffic and provincial and municipal offence division.

Small claims courts are examples of lower level civil courts and in most provinces, these civil courts will deal with civil claims of $10,000 or less while superior courts will deal with cases that involve higher amounts. (In British Columbia, the floor for small claims courts is $25,000 and Ontario is also rising the ceiling for these courts to that amount in 2010).

Within the criminal division, provincial courts deal with less serious summary conviction offences. They will also hold preliminary hearings for more serious criminal offences but the trial itself will be held in a superior court.

Family courts at this level will deal with disputes over child custody and maintenance (support) but are not authorized to grant divorces or settle real property (e.g., real estate) matters.


## Provincial Superior Courts

The highest trial level courts in the provinces are superior courts and they have different names in different provinces and are called the Court of Queen's Bench, the Supreme Court, the Superior Court, or the Divisional Court.

There are two levels of provincial superior court -- the trial and the appeal court. Most provincial trial courts deal with different branches of law so the *surrogate* division of a provincial court will deal exclusively with wills and estates; *family* division will hear divorces custody, matrimonial property, and support cases; and *criminal* division will hear only criminal cases and some appeals from the lower provincial courts.

The proceedings in superior courts are more formal than lower level provincial courts and parties are more likely to be represented by counsel. Judges in superior courts are appointed and paid by the federal government.

Jury trials are only heard in the superior courts.

In recent years, there has been a trend towards the development of specialized courts such as a Drug Treatment Courts and Mental Health Courts in Toronto and Kitchener.

## Appeal Courts

Each province also has a provincial Court of Appeal. The highest court in the land is the federal Supreme Court of Canada.

If a court decision is appealed, the appellant must satisfy the court that the trial-level judge did not follow the rules or procedure or that the judge made an error in the application of the law, whether in the choice of the precedent or in interpreting the principle established in the precedent case or statutory provision.

Court of Appeal typically assume that the facts of the case are correct and they do not typically rehear witnesses' testimonies or accept new evidence.

They focus on how the law was applied and are mostly concerned with due process and whether there were any errors in law. If a trial was conducted according to the rules, a court of appeal will not overturn a lower court decision.

If serious rules were broken, the appeal court can overturn a verdict and/or order a new trial.

## The Supreme Court of Canada

The Supreme Court of Canada hears appeals from the courts of appeal of all provinces. There are only limited situations in which one has a right of appeal to the Supreme Court. In the vast majority of cases, the Supreme Court decides whether or not to hear an appeal and grants appeals in cases of national importance or when the issues have great significance to the law in Canada. The Supreme Court does not explain why it decides to hear or refuse to hear a case.

Because the *Charter* has given the Supreme Court a significant role in interpreting the law, the appointment of Supreme Court Justices to the court had taken on great political significance. In the U.S., the President nominates the candidates and there are public hearings. The process is very politicized and candidates are often chosen because of their stand on issues such as abortion and civil rights.

One important feature of our court system is meant to ensure that the proceedings are fair, impartial and legitimate is their openness. With few exceptions, the courts in Canada are open to the public and the media. Openness ensures that the public can attend and see for themselves how trials are held and whether or not justice is served.

On occasion, witness may be excluded from part of hearing so that their testimony will not be tainted by listening to the testimony of other witnesses. In addition, it is common for judges to place a media ban on the publishing the names of sexual assault victims and children, evidence presented in a preliminary hearing, and the names of young persons involved in the proceedings.

The Criminal Justice Act allows a judge to exclude any person from a hearing to protect child witnesses and in the interest of public morals.

## THE CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS

The *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom* was enacted as part of the *Constitution Act 1982* when Canada moved away from the *British North America Act 1867* and replaced it with the *Constitution Act* in 1982.

The purpose of the *Constitution Act 1982* was to serve the ties Canada had with England and to give the government of Canada sole responsibility for changing or amending the Constitution. Thus it is said that the Constitution was "patriated."

The *Constitution Act 1982* also included the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.

## Limitations of the Charter

The *Charter* deals only with matters between the public and the government and governs the manner in which government official use their powers in their dealing with members of the public.

Although the *Charter* itself does not apply the relationship between individual citizens, Governments have passed various statutes that regulate these relationships.

Critics point out that it is not always possible to determine when one is involved with government rather than an individual or a private corporation. Crown corporations, for instance, are owned and to some extent controlled by the government but they are listed as private entities.

## The Scope of the Charter

Despite the fact that the *Charter* does not regulate the relationships between private citizens, it clearly has an important and indirect impact. Governments pass all kinds of laws to regulate commerce, for instance, and these laws must be consistent with the *Charter*.

Every province in Canada has its own human rights code and this too must not be in violation of the provisions contained in the *Charter*.

## Qualifications

There are two major qualifications no the application of the *Charter*.

1. Section 1 guarantees the rights and freedoms contained therein "subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."

  This means tat freedom and rights are not absolute and that the government may pass legislation that infringes on our rights if such legislation is reasonable. This means that the courts will often be in the position to make judgement on whether or not the infringement on citizens rights are justified. One of the grounds for this is what is known as "the greater good" of society. Another reasonable limitation relates to the protection of other people's rights. Thus, your freedom to throw a punch ends where my nose begins.

  A clear example of such limitation relates to the provision regarding freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Reasonable limits of expression are imposed on us through laws that prohibit pornography, slander, incitement to violence, and hate materials. Society will not allow the right to free speech to be used to harm others.

2. Section 33 also has a major limitation on the *Charter* known as the "notwithstanding clause" which states:

  >Parliament or the legislature of the province may expressly declare an Act of Parliament or the legislature as the case may be, that the Act of a provision thereof, shall operate notwithstanding a provision included in Section 2 or Section 7 to 15 of the Charter.

  This is a powerful on the *Charter* since Section 2 and 7 to 15 contain fundamental freedoms, legal rights, and equality rights.

  This provision means that the federal government of any provincial legislature can pass a law that violates fundamental rights by simply invoking the notwithstanding clause.

  The Quebec government did just that in 1989 to permit only French-language signs in the province. Although they were heavily criticized for using this clause, the government argued that it was necessary to preserve the French language in the province of Quebec.

  Only limitation on the notwithstanding clause is the "sunset clause" that automatically voids the legislation after give years. This means that the legislation must be renewed by the government that passed it on a five-year basis.

## Fundamental Freedoms and the *Charter*

One category of basic rights and freedoms guaranteed under the *Charter* are those set out in Section 2, which provides for fundamental freedoms. This includes freedom of religion, thought, belief, expression, opinion, and freedom of the press. Also included is freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association.

## Democratic Rights

Section 3,4 and 5 contain protections for basic democratic rights that cannot be overridden with the use of the notwithstanding clause. These include the right of all citizens of Canada to vote, the requirement that federal and provincial legislatures have an election at least every five years, and that Parliament shall have a sitting at least every twelve months.

Historically, various groups in Canada have been denied the vote including federal inmates, Asians, and women. Women did not obtain the right to vote until 1920.

Inmates were granted the right to vote by the Supreme Court in 1995 in the case of *Sauve vs. Canada*. Sauve, a federal penitentiary inmate, sued the federal government for the right to vote and was granted that right by the Supreme Court. The court ruled that the practice of denying inmates the right to vote violated Section 3 of the *Charter* and that such a violation could not be reasonably justified under Section 1.

Even today, there are people who are denied the right to vote but these exclusions are regarded as reasonable infringements on their rights. Thus persons under the age of 18 cannot vote nor can persons who are not Canadian citizens.

It should be kept in mind that the right to vote as contained in the *Charter* applies to federal and provincial elections but not to municipal elections.

## Mobility Rights

Section 6 of the *Charter* gives Canadian citizens and permanent residents the right or leave and enter Canada, to travel and live within the country, and to earn a living in Canada.

There are significant limitations on employment rights, however, since each province has the right to regulate various professions and require provincial accreditation before allowing a person to practice their trade or profession in that province. Provincial standards for certification and licensing are seen as reasonable limits on employment rights under the *Charter*.

Provinces also have the right to impose a reasonable residence period before allowing a person from another province to qualify for various provincial benefits such as welfare and medical coverage.

Subsection 6(4) of the *Charter* permits affirmative action programs to right imbalances in various areas of employment. Thus programs that give preferential hiring treatment for women, Aboriginals, or other minorities will be supported by the *Charter* if these are used in industries in which these groups are under-represented. Even though affirmative action programs discriminate against certain groups (e.g., such as men) and violate quality provisions guaranteed in the *Charter*, they are nonetheless viewed as reasonable under these *Charter* provisions.

## Legal Rights (Text 81)

Section 7 to 14 sets out legal rights which includes the statements that "everyone has the right to life, liberty and the security of person and the right not be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice" (Section 7).

The right to life does not extend to an unborn fetus and this means that abortions are legal in Canada.

The concept liberty is defined liberally and includes the right to move about, associate with whomever one wants, marry whomever one wants (with some restrictions), etc.

Under this section of the *Charter*, it is made clear that a person cannot be deprived of their liberty without due process which has been interpreted to mean a fair, impartial hearing based on the principles of fundamental justice and one in which the accused person has the opportunity to defend him/herself.

A major omission from our legal rights is the fact that there are no provisions for property rights as Americans have in their constitution.

Section 8 provides that everyone has the right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. This means that any searches have to be authorized under the law and that the police must obtain a search warrant based on sworn evidence of probable cause in front of a member of the judiciary.

The law does allow a search and seizure by the police under certain circumstances such as an arrest. this is considered a reasonable violation of a person's rights since the person is being arrested and the police have a right to search for weapons.

Section 9 provides that everyone has the right not to arbitrarily detained of imprisoned. This means that the police must have legal grounds to detain you (such as situations in which you are required to take a breathalyzer). The same provision applies to imprisonment and the *Charter* makes it clear that the law must be enforced consistently and not in an arbitrary fashion.

Section 10 requires that everyone who is detained has the right to be told of their rights to consult a lawyer, be given the opportunity to contact one, and to challenge the arrest or detention based on the grounds of *habeus corpus*. *Habeus corpus* refers to a historical right to appear in front of judge and to challenge the legality of one's arrest or imprisonment.

The terms arrest and detention refers to compulsory restraint and compulsion occurs when the police arrest or detain a person or when the person believes that they are being detained and cannot leave.

Section 11 contains a number of provisions that deal with criminal proceedings and trials. A person who is charged under federal or provincial laws has the following rights:

* To be informed without delay of the specific offence
* To be tried within a reasonable time
* Not to be compelled to be a witness against him/herself
* To be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to the law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal
* Not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause
* To be tried by jury if the maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment over five years
* Not to be found guilty for an offence that was not an offence when committed
* If found guilty or not guilty of an offence not to be tried again for that same offence
* If found guilty, and the punishment has been changed since the commission of the offence, to be afforded the lesser punishment

Section 11.b was applied in the case of *R vs. Askov* (1990) in which the Supreme Court dismissed the charges because the accused's rights had been violated due to the excessive delay (over three years) in bringing the case to trial. The delay was due backlogs in the Ontario courts and the court suggested that delays of over right months were unreasonable.

This decision led to tens of thousands of criminal and quasi-criminal cases being stayed or dismissed across Canada and to a huge outcry by victims and others who felt that criminal were being let off on a technicality. The Supreme Court was taken aback by the backlash and in later cases, they made it clear that delays of over eight months did not constitute an unreasonable delay if there were extenuating circumstances that justified the delay.

The court has made it clear, however, that it expects the government to provide sufficient resources to the court system to prevent delays and that it will not tolerate "systemic" delays.

Section 11 (c) protects a person against self-incrimination. This includes the right to remain silent at arrest and the right to refrain from testifying.

In Canada, suspects do not have to answer police questions and they have the right to be cautioned (a) that they have the right to remain silent; (b) that any statement they give may be used against them in a court of law; and (c) that they have the right to have an attorney present and to contact an attorney.

Violation of these rights are likely to lead to any admissions of guilt made by the accused inadmissible in court.

Accused persons also have the right to refrain from testifying in any hearing in which they are the accused. In cases in which the accused does not take the stand, the Crown cannot make a comment about this to the jury.

This right is something that is not available all over the world and in many countries, the accused must take the stand and answer questions put to them.

Section 11 (d) also enshrines a former common law principle. It simply states that no person shall be considered guilty of an offence unless convicted of that offence at a proper trial.

This principle obviously does not apply to arrest and prosecution since the police must have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest and thus operate on a presumption of guilt. So too must a Crown Attorney have reasonable grounds to proceed with the prosecution.

The principle applies more to the restraint and punishment aspects of the justice system. Thus bail provisions are fairly liberal based on a presumption of innocence and sentences cannot be imposed until after the conviction.

This presumption of innocence also applies in civil matters since people are typically suspended with pay if they are under criminal charges and fired only after they are found guilty.

Section 11 (h) deals with double jeopardy and replaces a former common law principle or prohibition that a person must not be put on trial twice for the same offence. If a defendant wishes to argue that he/she has previously been acquitted or convicted of a specific offence, the defence will make special pleas of *autrefois acquit* or *autrefois convict* as a bar to an indictment. This is a claim by the defendant that he/she has lawfully been acquitted or convicted of the offence and this particular issue will be heard by a judge only without a jury present.

This has to be the same offence or an included offence on which the person has already been tried. For example, because murder is an offence that includes manslaughter, a person acquitted of murder cannot then be tried on a charge of manslaughter for the same offence.

12: Everyone has the right not be subjected to any cruel or unusual treatment of punishment.

The constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was used in 1987 to strike down a section of the former Narcotic Control Act (now called the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act) that required a minimum sentence of seven years for importing any amount of a narcotic. This meant that a person coming across the border with one marijuana joint was subject to this penalty and the Supreme Court ruled in R. vs. Smith that in some circumstances, the penalty of seven years imprisonment could be "grossly disproportionate" to the offence committed and struck down the minimum sentence as unconstitutional.

13: A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have any incriminating evidence so given used in incriminate what witness in any other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury.

14: A party or witness in any proceedings who does not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted or who is deaf has the right to the assistance of an interpreter.

## Equality Rights

Section 15 of the *Charter* deal with equality rights.

15 (1): Every individual in equal before and under the law and has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability.

(2): Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability.

This section of the *Charter* was used in court decision in both British Columbia and Ontario in which provincial marriage legislation prohibiting same-sex marriages was ruled unconstitutional because is violates Section 15 of the *Charter* and the rights of gay men and women to be treated equally. Consequently, the federal government passed Bill C-38 in 2005 providing for same-sex marriages in all proves and territories of Canada.

## The Role of Courts and the Impact of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* on the Criminal law

Prior to 1982, Parliament was the supreme authority since it had the power to pass any laws it wanted subject to the division of powers between it and the provinces.

Because the Constitution is the supreme law in Canada, the passage of the *Charter* has given the courts a veto over laws enacted by both the federal or provincial governments.

The enactment of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* dramatically changed the powers of the courts in Canada and significantly changed the relationship between the judiciary and elected representatives in both the Federal Parliament and Provincial legislatures.

The *Charter* represents an entrenched bill of rights and empowers judges throughout the land to declare any piece of legislation to be invalid if it infringes on an individual's rights as outlined in the *Charter*.

The wording of the *Charter* also empowers the courts since the terminology used is very broad and not clearly defined. This means that it is left to the courts to interpret the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* in individual cases. The process of interpretation and judgements has led to the creation of new law.

This has been extremely controversial because it can and has resulted in the unelected judicial branch of the government striking down laws passed by elected representatives of the Canadian public. Since 1982, the courts in Canada have proven that they are willing to make such decisions and there have been many court decisions that have nullified various statutes of parts of statutes. This has happened with both regulatory offences and criminal offences.

Critics point out that the Supreme Court of Canada has taken a more activist stance much like the Supreme Court in the United States which provides a check on the power of Congress and the President.

One of the most famous and controversial instances involves abortion law. In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down Section 287 of the Criminal Code, which made performing abortions a criminal offence unless carried out in an accredited hospital after being approved by a therapeutic abortion committee. Abortions were only legal under these conditions and if the committee had certified that the continuation of the pregnancy would or would likely endanger the woman's life or health.

Dr. Henry Morgentaler had consistently defined the law by performing abortions in private clinics without the abortions being accredited by a therapeutic abortion committee. In *R. vs. Morgentaler, Smolig and Scott* (1988), the Supreme court ruled that Section 287 of the Criminal Code infringed on Section 7 of the *Charter*, which guarantees the "right to life, liberty, and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."

This essentially meant that the Supreme Court struck down Section 287 as unconstitutional. In 1992, the government of Canada attempted to replace Section 287 with new criminal code provisions dealing with abortion and although they passed throughout the House of Commons, they failed to gain approval from the Senate. As a consequence, Canada is one of the few countries in the world that does not have any criminal laws prohibiting or regulating abortions. Abortions in Canada are treated in the same manner as any other medical procedure and the rules governing abortions lie outside of the criminal law.

The Morgentaler case is used by critics who argue that the courts have too much power and that the exercise of this power has undermined the right of an elected and representatives government to govern.

Most legal scholars do not take this position and point out that the Courts have been very reluctant to strike down laws and will do so only in exceptional cases. They also note that the *Charter* does not require the courts to strike down laws that violate *Charter* rights in all cases. Section 1 of the *Charter* states that "the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by laws as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society." Section 1 thus makes it clear that rights guaranteed in the *Charter* are not absolute and that they may be overridden if instances in which it is necessary to achieve "collective goals of fundamental importance."

Section 1 requires the courts to engage in a balancing act between individual rights and the common good for society. In *R vs. Oakes*, the Supreme Court of Canada laid down some factors that need to be considered when deciding whether or not the violation of individual rights is justifiable for the greater good of society. The Court ruled that the objective of the legislation must be of "sufficient importance" to warrant the suspension of a person's rights and the objective must relate to issues that are "pressing and substantial."

The Court also requires that the means chosen are reasonable, justified, and proportional. In the *Oakes* case, the law under the *Narcotic Control Act* (not changed to the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*) allowed the Crown to charge someone in possession of a narcotic with the more serious offence of trafficking regardless of the amount. The accused then had to prove that the narcotic was meant for personal use and not for sale in order to avoid being convicted for possession for the purpose of trafficking. The Court found that the previsions in the law violated the accused's rights "to be presumed innocent until proven guilty."

The Court also ruled that even though the objective was worthy (deterring drug trafficking), the means were not proportional or rational (how can you deter traffickers by convicting people who are only users?). Thus, this section of the legislation was struck down as unconstitutional.

## Summary

Most legal scholars seem to hold the view that the Supreme Court of Canada has generally been reluctant to use its immense powers to strike down legislation. In cases in which they have done so, they have articulated very clear and fundamental reasons for invalidating legislation or provision within the law. Few scholars argue that the Supreme court has worked to thwart or undermine the democratic wishes of Canadian and their elected representatives. Most suggest that the Court tries very hard to work with the government and to assist in the implementation of the will of Canadians in legislation that is consistent with *Charter* rights of its citizens.

Many also contend that our elected representatives are often quite happy to allow the courts make ruling on controversial issues that they would prefer to avoid. One clear example is the case of gay marriages, which the courts have taken a firm stance in support of gay rights. They struck down provisions of the *Marriage Act* in various provinces that limited marriages to heterosexual couples only on the grounds that this was a violation of the rights of gay couples.

The result that in Canada, gays have the right to marry and that right was given to them not from our elected representatives, but from the courts. The politicians, critics argued, willingly relinquished their responsibility and allowed the courts to decide because the issue was too controversial.

## The Spanking Law

Section 43 of the *Criminal Code of Canada* allows the use of corporal punishment by parents, teachers, and those standing in place of parents if the force is reasonable and is administered for the purpose of correction. It states:

>Correction of Child by Force

Sec 43: Every schoolteacher, parent, or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances.

The courts have ruled that this section allows corporal punishment of a child if the force is reasonable and is for the purpose of correcting or educating the child. The punishment is restricted to children between the age of two and twelve only. Presumably, children under two years old are too young to be corrected and children twelve and older can be punished in other ways if required. Similarly children suffering from a disability may be exempt if they are also unable to learn from the punishment.

Teachers can use reasonable force on a child only to "remove a children from a classroom or secure compliance with instructions and not merely as corporal punishment."

The amount of force used must be of a transitory and trifling nature and not such as to cause physical injury Degrading, inhuman, or harmful conduct is not protected. Discipline by the use of objects or blows of slaps to the head has been ruled to be unreasonable. Punishment stemming from the caregiver's frustration, loss of temper or abusive personality is not reasonable.

The courts have also ruled that in determining whether the force used was reasonable under the circumstances, they will consider the customs of contemporary Canadian society and no the customs of the accused's former country where corporal punishment may have greater acceptance (*R. vs. Baptiste and Baptiste* 1980). Religious beliefs cannot be used to expand the scope of this provision: *R. vs. Poulin* (2002).

Many Canadians object to Section 43 which they describes as the spanking law because they see it as barbaric and a violation of children's rights under the *Charter.* One such group mounted a challenge to Section 43 that was heard in the Supreme Court in 2004. In Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law vs. Canada (2004) the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 43 ruling that it did not violate the *Charter of Rights*.

The Foundation argued that Section 43 violated a child's rights to equality under Section 15, the child's right to security of the person under Section 7, and the child's rights to be protected from cruel and unusual punishment under Section 12 of the *Charter*.

They also argued that Canada had an obligation under the United Nation Convention on the Rights of the Child to strike down the law and protect children from abuse. The Ontario Association of Children's Aid was granted Intervener status in support of the applicant's challenge.

A number of other groups including the Canadian Teacher's Federation were also granted Intervener status but on the other side in favour of the constitutionality of Section 43.

In January 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada in a 6-3 vote upheld the constitutionality of Section 43 allowing parents and others to use corrective force against children between the ages of 2-12.

Two of the dissenting judges thought that Section 43 should be struck down because it violated the equality provisions of the *Charter*. Adults cannot be struck and children should have the same rights. The third dissenting judge took the view that parents have the right to correct a child but teachers do not.

Even though the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 43, they substantially narrowed its scope and defined and set out a number of limitation on the use of force by caregivers.

Many observers were surprised that the court did not strike down the "spanking law" since many other countries in the world have banned corporal punishment against children. In addition, standards in society are rapidly changing, there are strong values against eh use of force or violence to solve problems, and there is a good deal of support for the elimination of this section amongst Canadians.

Scholars have suggested two main reasons for the Court's reluctance to strike down the law:

1. For one thing, the Supreme Court may have been reluctant to impose their will or values on parents and families. There are still strong values that are supportive of family and parental autonomy and a decision to eliminate "spanking" may have been seen as too intrusive of parental rights.

2. The second reason given is that the Supreme Court may have been reluctant to strike down a law such as this because it did not want to usurp the role of parliament and the power of the legislative assembly.

  The Court may have been felt that this is an issue that should ultimately be decided by our elected representatives.

  Indeed, their decision to uphold the constitutionality of Section 43 may be taken as evidence that the Supreme Court is reluctant to overstretch its powers and strike down laws that have been passed by the government.
