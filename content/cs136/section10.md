# Dynamic Memory & ADTs in C

#### The heap

The **heap** is the final section in the C memory model.

It can be thought of a "big pile" (or "pool") of memory that is available to your program.

Memory is **dynamically** "borrowed" from the heap. We call this **allocation**.

When the borrowed memory is no longer needed, it can be "returned" and possible **reused**. We call this **deallocation**.

If too much memory has already been allocated, attempts to borrow additional memory fail.

#### malloc

The `malloc` (memory allocation) function obtains memory the heap dynamically. It is provided in `<stdin.h>`.

```C
// malloc(s) requests s bytes of memory from the heap
//	and returns a pointer to a block of s bytes, or
//	NULL if not enough memory is available
// time: O(1)
```

For example, if you want enough space for an array of 100 ints.

```C
int *my_array = malloc(100 *sizeof(int));
```

or an array of n `struct posn`:

```C
struct posn *my_posn_array = malloc(n * sizeof(struct posn));
```

**You should always use `sizeof` with `malloc` to improve portability and to improve communication.**

Seashell will allow

```C
int *my_array = malloc(400);
```

instead of

```C
int *my_array = malloc(100 * sizeof(int));
```

but the latter is much better style and is more portable.

>Strictly speaking, the type of the `malloc` parameter is `size_t`,
which is a special type produced by the `sizeof` operator.
`size_t` and `int` are different types of integers.
Seashell is mostly forgiving, but in other C environments using
an int when C expects a `size_t` may generate a warning.
The proper `printf` placeholder to print a `size_t` is `%zd`.

>The declaration for the malloc function is:
`void *malloc(size_t s);`
The return type is a `(void *)` (void pointer), a special pointer
that can point at any type.
`int *pi = malloc(sizeof(int));`
`struct posn *pp = malloc(sizeof(struct posn));`

An unsuccessful call of `malloc` returns `NULL`.

In practice it's good style to check every `malloc` return value and gracefully handle a `NULL` instead of crashing.

```C
int *my_array = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
if (my_array == NULL) {
	printf(""Sorry dude, I'm out of memory! I'm exiting....\n");
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

In the "real world" you should always perform this check, but in this course, you do not have to check a `NULL` return value unless instructed otherwise.

The heap memory proved by `malloc` is **uninitialized**.

```C
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
printf("the mystery value is: %d\n", *p);
```

Although `malloc` is very complicated, for the purposes of this course, you can assume that `malloc` is $O(1)$.

>There is also a `calloc` function which essentially calls `malloc` and then "initialize" the memory by filling it with zeros. `calloc` is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the block.

#### free

For every block of memory obtained through `malloc`, you must eventually `free` the memory (when the memory is no longer in use).

```C
// free(p) returns memory at a p back to the heap
// requiresL p must be from a previous malloc
// effects: the memory at p is invalid
// time: $O(1)$
```

**In the Seashell environment, you must `free` every block**

```C
int *my_array = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
// ...
// ...
free(my_array);
```

#### Invalid after free

Once a block of memory is `free`, reading from or writing to that memory is invalid and may cause errors (or unpredictable results).

Similarly, it is invalid to `free` memory that was not returned by a `malloc` or that has already been `free`.

```C
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
free(p);
int k = *p; // INVALID
*p = 42; // INVALID
free(p); // INVALID
p = NULL; // GOOD STYLE
```

Pointer variables may still contain the address of the memory that was freed, so it is often good style to assign `NULL` to a freed pointer variable.

#### Memory leaks

A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is not eventually freed.

Programs that leak memory may suffer degraded performance or eventually crash.

```C
int *ptr;
ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); // memory leak!
```

In this example, the address from the original `malloc` has been overwritten.

That memory is now "lost" (or leaked) and so it can never by freed.

#### Garbage collection

Many modern languages (including Racket) have a **garbage collector**.

A garbage collector **detects** when memory is no longer in use and **automatically** frees memory and returns it to the heap.

One disadvantage of a garbage collector is that it can be slow and affect performance, which is a concern in high performance computing.

#### Merge sort

In section 09 we saw a Racket implementation of the divide and conquer algorithm **merge sort** that is $O(n\logn)$.

In merge sort, the data is split into two smaller groups. After each smaller group is sorted, they are merged together.

To simplify our C implementation, we will use a `merge` helper function.

```C
// merge(dest, src1, len1, src2, len2) modifies dest to contain
//	the elements from both src1 and src2 in sorted order
// requires: length of dest is at least (len1 + len2)
//			 src1 and src2 are sorted
// effects: modifies dest
// time: O(n), where n is len1 + len2

void merge(int dest[], const int src1[], int len1, const int src2[], int len2) {
	int pos1 = 0;
	int pos2 = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < len1 + len2; ++i) {
		if (pos1 == len1 || (pos2 < len2 && src2[pos2] < src1[pos1])) {
			dest[i] = src2[pos2];
			++pos2;
		} else {
			dest[i] = src1[pos1];
			++pos1;
		}
	}
}

void merge_sort(int a[], int len) {
	if (len <= 1) return;
	int llen = len / 2;
	int rlen = len - llen;

	int *left = malloc(llen * sizeof(int));
	int *right = malloc(rlen * sizeof(int));

	for (int i = 0; i < llen; ++i) left[i] = a[i];
	for (int i = 0; i < rlen; ++i) right[i] = a[i + llen];

	merge_sort(left, llen);
	merge_sort(right, rlen);

	merge(a, left, llen, right, rlen);

	free(left);
	free(right);
}
```

#### Duration
Using dynamic (heap) memory, a function can obtain memory that **persists** after the function has returned.

```C
// build_array(n) returns a new array initialized with
// values a[0] = 0, a[1] = 1, ... a[n-1] = n-1
// effects: allocates a heap array (caller must free)
int *build_array(int len) {
	assert(len > 0);
	int *a = malloc(len * sizeof(int));
	for (int i=0; i < len; ++i) {
		a[i] = i;
	}
	return a; // array exists beyond function return
}
```

The caller (client) is responsible for freeing the memory (the contract should communicate this).

The `<string.h>` function `strdup` makes a duplicate of a string.

```C
// my_strdup(s) makes a duplicate of s
// effects: allocates memory (caller must free)
char *my_strdup(const char *s) {
	char *newstr = malloc((strlen(s) + 1) * sizeof(char));
	strcpy(newstr, s);
	return newstr;
}
```

Recall that the `strcpy(dest, src)` copies the characters from `src` to `dest`, and the `dest` array must be large enough.

When allocating memory for strings, don't forget to the include space for the null terminator.

#### Resizing arrays

Because `malloc` requires the size of the block of memory to be allocated, it does not seem to solve the problem:

"What if we do not know the length of an array in advance?"

To solve this problem, we can **resize** an array by:
*	creating a new array
*	copying the items from the old to the new array
*	free the old array

#### realloc

To make resizing arrays easier, there is a `realloc` function.

```C
// realloc(p, newsize) resizes the memory block at p
// 	to be newsize and returns a pointer to the
// 	new location, or NULL if unsuccessful
// requires: p must be from a previous malloc/realloc
// effects: the memory at p is invalid (freed)
// time: O(n), where n is newsize
```

Similar to our previous example, `realloc` preserves the contents from the old array location.

```C
int *my_array = malloc(100 * sizeof(int));
// stuff happens
my_array = realloc(my_array, 101 * sizeof(int));
```

The pointer returned by `realloc` may actually be the original pointer, depending on the circumstances.

Regardless, after `realloc` **only the new returned pointer can be used**. You should assume that the parameter of `realloc` was freed and is not invalid.

Typically, `realloc` is used to request a larger size and the additional memory is uninitialized.

If the size is smaller, the extraneous memory is discarded.

>`realloc(NULL, s)` behaves the same as `malloc(s)`.
`realloc(ptr, 0)` behaves the same as `free(ptr)`.

#### String I/O: strings of unknown size

In section 08 we saw how reading in strings can be susceptible to buffer overruns.

```C
char str[81];
int retval = scanf("%s", str);
```

The target array is often oversized to ensure there is capacity to store the string. Unfortunately, regardless of the length of the array, a buffer overrun may occur.

```C
// readstr() reads in a new string from I/O or return NULL if EOF
// effects: allocates memory (caller must free)

char *readstr(void) {
	char c;
	if (scanf(" %s", &c) != 1) return NULL;
	char *str = malloc(1 * sizeof(char));
	int len = 0;
	do {
		str[len] = c;
		++len;
		str = realloc(str, (len + 1) * sizeof(char));
		if (scanf("%s", &c) != 1) break;
	} while (c != ' ' && c != '\n');
	str[len] = '\0';
	return str;
}
```

#### Amortized analysis

Unfortunately, the running time of `readstr` is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

This is because `realloc` is $O(n)$ and occurs inside of the loop;

A better approach might be to allocate **more memory than necessary** and only call `realloc` when the array is "full".

A popular strategy is to **double** the size of the array when it is full.

Similar to working with maximum-length arrays, we need to keep track of the actual length in addition to allocated length.

```C
char *readstr(void) {
	char c;
	if (scanf(" %s", &c) != 1) return NULL;
	int maxlen = 1;
	char *str = malloc(maxlen * sizeof(char));
	int len = 0;
	do {
		str[len] = c;
		++len;
		if (len == maxlen) {
			maxlen *= 2;
			str = realloc(str, maxlen * sizeof(char));
		}
		if (scanf("%c", &c) != 1) break;
	} while (c != ' ' && c != '\n');
	str[len] = '\0';
	str = realloc(str, (len + 1) * sizeof(char));
	return str;
}
```

With our "doubling" strategy, most iterations will be $O(1)$, unless it is necessary to resize (`realloc`) the array.

the resizing time for the first 32 iterations would be:

2,4,0,8,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64

For $n$ iterations, the total resizing time is at most:

$$2n+n+\frac{n}{2}+\frac{n}{4}+\cdots + 2 = 4n-2 = O(n)$$

By using this doubling strategy, the total run time for `readstr` is now only $O(n)$.

In other words, the **amortized** ("average") time for each iteration is: $O(n)/n = O(1)$.

#### ADTs in C

With dynamic memory, we now have the ability to implement an *Abstract Data Type (ADT)* in C.

In section 02, the first ADT we say was a simple account ADT, which stored a username and a password. It demonstrated **information hiding**, which provides both *security* and *flexibility*.

We will also need to use **opaque** structures (incomplete declarations without fields).

In the **interface**, we only provide an *incomplete declaration*. In addition to the normal operations, we provide functions to **create** and **destroy** instances of the ADT.

```C
// account.h -- a simple account ADT module

struct account; // incomplete

// create_account(username, password) creates an account 
// with the given username and password 
// effects: allocates memory (client must call destroy_account) 
struct account *create_account(const char *username, const char *password); 

// destroy_account(acc) removes all memory for acc 
// effects: memory at acc is free'd and invalid
void destroy_account(struct account *acc);
```

Because the interface only provides an incomplete declaration, the **client** does not know the fields of the `account` structure.

The client can only define a pointer to the structure, which is returned by `create_account`.

```C
// client.c

char username[9]; char password[41];

// ...

struct account *my_account = create_account(username, password);

// ...

destroy_account(my_account);
```

The compete structure declaration only appears in the **implementation**.

```C
// account.c
struct account {
	char *uname;
	char *pword; 
};
```

`create_account` returns a pointer to a **new** account.

```C
struct account *create_account(const char *username, const char *password) {
	struct account *a = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
	a->uname = malloc((strlen(username) + 1) * sizeof(char)); strcpy(a->uname, username);
	a->pword = malloc((strlen(password) + 1) * sizeof(char)); strcpy(a->pword, password);
	return a;
}
```

It makes **duplicates** of the username and password strings provided by the client.

In C, our ADT also requires a `destroy_account` to `free` the memory created (both the fields and the structure itself).

```C
void destroy_account(struct account *a) {
	free(a->username); 
	free(a->password); 
	free(a);
}
```

The remaining operations are straightforward.

```C
const char *get_username(const struct account *acc) {
	return acc->uname;
}

bool is_correct_password(const struct account *acc, const char *word) {
	return (strcmp(acc->pword, word) == 0);
}
```

#### Implementing a Stack ADT

The **Stack ADT** (one of the Collection ADTs) is more representative.

The interface is nearly identical to the stack implementation from section 08 that demonstrated maximum-length arrays.

The only differences are: it uses an opaque structure, it provides `create` and `destroy` functions, and there is no maximum: it can store any arbitrary number of integers.

```C
// stack.h (INTERFACE)

struct stack;

struct stack *create_stack(void);

bool stack_is_empty(const struct stack *s);

int stack_top(const struct stack *s);

int stack_pop(struct stack *s);

void stack_push(int item, struct stack *s);

void stack_destroy(const struct stack *s);
```

The Stack ADT uses the "doubling" strategy. It is typical to have an initial size that is not too wasteful, but avoids excessive doubling for small stacks.

```C
// stack.c (IMPLEMENTATION)

struct stack {
	int len;
	int maxlen;
	int *data;
};

static const int initial_size = 32;

struct stack *create_stack(void) {
	struct stack *s = malloc(sizeof(struct stack));
	s->len = 0;
	s->maxlen = initial_size;
	s->data = malloc(s->maxlen * sizeof(int));
	return s;
}
```

The doubling is implemented in `push`.

`destroy` must `free` the field and the structure itself.

```C
// Time: O(1) [amortized]

void stack_push(int item, struct stack *s) {
	assert(s);
	if (s->len == s->maxlen) {
		s->maxlen *= 2;
		s->data = realloc(s->data, s->maxlen * sizeof(int));
	}
	s->data[s->len] = item;
	s->len += 1;
}

void stack_destroy(struct stack *s) {
	free(s->data);
	free(s);
}
```

The remaining operations are identical to the maximum-length implementation.

```C
bool stack_is_empty(const struct stack *s) {
	assert(s);
	return s->len == 0;
}

int stack_top(const struct stack *s) {
	assert(s);
	assert(s->len);
	return s->data[s->len - 1];
}

int stack_pop(struct stack *s) {
	assert(s);
	assert(s->len);
	s->len -= 1;
	return s->data[s->len];
}
```
