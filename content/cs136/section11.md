# Section 11: Linked Data Structures

#### Linked lists

Racket's like type is more commonly known as a **linked list**

![linked list](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg2.PNG)

Each **node** contains an **item** and a **link** (pointer) to the **next** node in the list.

The last node's link contains a special **sentinel value** to indicate it is the last node.

A linked list is usually represent as a link to the **front** of the list.

![linked list front](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg3.PNG)

Unlike arrays, linked list nodes are not arranged sequentially in memory. In general, there is no convenient way to "jump" to the $i$-th element in a linked list. The linked list must be **traversed** from the front. Traversing a linked list is $O(n)$.

A significant advantage of a linked list is that its length can easily change, and the length does not need to be known in advance.

The memory for each node is allocated dynamically.

#### Functional vs. Imperative approach

The core concept of a linked list data structure is independent of any single paradigm.

However, the approach used to **implement** and write functions that process linked lists are very different.

Programming with linked lists further illustrates the differences between the two paradigms.

#### Dynamic memory in Racket

Racket uses dynamic memory, but it is mostly *hidden* from the programmer.

The `cons` function dynamically creates a **new** linked list node.

The `list` function and quote list notation `'(1 2 3)` implicitly use `cons`.

The only other method of using dynamic memory in Racket is the constructor to `make` a **new** structure.

Knowing how `cons` uses dynamic memory, consider how the following Racket function `sqr-list` constructs a **new list**

```Racket
(define (sqr-list lst)
(cond 	[(empty? lst) empty]
[else (cons (sqr (first lst) (sqr-list (rest lst))))]))

(define a '(10 3 5 7))
(define b (sqr-list a))
```

![linked list racket](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg7.PNG)

In the functional programming paradigm, this is the only sensical meaning, because there is no mutation.

In the imperative programming paradigm, a "square list" function is more likely to **mutate** an existing list instead of producing a new list.

>In practice, most imperative list functions perform mutation. If the caller wants a new list (instead of mutating an existing one), they can first make a copy of the original list and then mutate the new copy.

#### Mixing paradigms

Problems may arise if we naively use the functional paradigm in an imperative environment without considering the consequences.

This is especially important in C, where there is no garbage collector.

| Functional (Racket) | Imperative (C)       |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| no mutation         | mutation             |
| garbage collector   | no garbage collector |
| hidden pointers     | explicit pointers    |

The following example highlights the potential problems.

Recall the `insert` function used in Racket's `insertion sort`.

```Racket
;; (insert n slon) inserts n into a sorted list of numbers
(define (insert n slon)
(cons 	[(empty? slon) (cons n empty)]
[(<= n (first slon)) (cons n slon)]
[else (cons (first slon) (insert n (rest slon)))]))

(define a '(10 20 50 100))
(define b (insert 30 a))
```

![racket insert linked list](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg10.PNG)

The lists **share the last two nodes**

In Racket this behavior is completely transparent because there is **no mutation**, and there is ad **garbage collector**.

In an imperative language like C, this configuration is problematic.
*	If we apply a mutative function such as "square list" on `a`, then some of the elements of `b` will unexpectedly change.
*	If we explicitly `free` all of the memory for list `a`, then list `b`will become invalid.

List functions that perform computations and do not modify the list (or produce a new list) work well in both paradigms.

If a function mutates a list (or produces a "new" list), you should use caution to ensure that the result will not create further problems.

>In Racket, lists are immutable, and there is a special `mcons` function to generate a mutable list.
In the Scheme language, lists are mutable. This is one of the significant differences between Racket and Scheme.

#### Linked lists in C

There is no "official" way of implementing a linked list in C.

In this section we present a typical linked list structure that uses a **wrapper** strategy.

First, we declare a *linked list node* (`llnode`) that stores an "item" and a link (pointer) to the next node.

```C
struct llnode {
	int item;
	struct llnode *next;
};
```

A C structure can contain a *pointer* to its own structure type. This is the first **recursive data structure** we have seen in C.

For the last pointer in the list (or an empty list) we use a `NULL` pointer as a sentinel value.

As mentioned previously, we use a **wrapper** strategy, where we wrap the link to the first node inside of another structure (`llist`).

This makes some of the following code more straightforward.

```C
struct llist {
	struct llnode *front;
}
```

We also define a `list_create` function to create an empty list.

```C
struct llist *list_create(void) {
	struct llist *lst = malloc(sizeof(struct llist));
	list->front = NULL;
	return lst;
}
```

Of course, we need to add items to our linked list.

The following code creates a new node, and insert it at the front of the list.

```C
void add_front(int i, struct llist *lst) {
	struct llnode *node = malloc(sizeof(struct llnode));
	node->item = i;
	node->next = lst->front;
	lst->front = node;
}
```

#### Traversing a list

We can traverse a list **iteratively** or **recursively**.

When iterating through a list, we typically use a (`llnode`) pointer to keep track of the "current" node.

```C
int length(struct llist *lst) {
	int length = 0;
	struct llnode *node = lst->front;
	while (node) {
		++length;
		node = node->next;
	}
	return length;
}
```

Remember (`node`) will be false at the end of the list (`NULL`)

When using **recursion**, remember to recurse on a node (`llnode`) not the wrapper list itself (`llist`).

```C
int length_nodes(struct llnode *node) {
	if (node == NULL) return 0;
	return 1 + length_nodes(node->next);
}
```

You can write a corresponding wrapper function:

```C
int list_length(struct llist *lst) {
	return length_nodes(lst->front);
}
```

or call the recursive function directly on the front of the list.

```C
int len = length_nodes(lst->front);
```

#### Destroying a list

In C, we don't have a *garbage collector*, so we must be able to `free` our linked list. We need to free every node and the list wrapper.

When using an iterative approach, we are going to need two node pointers to ensure that the nodes are `freed` in a safe way.

```C
void list_destroy(struct llist *lst) {
	struct llnode *curnode = lst->front;
	while (curnode) {
		struct llnode *nextnode = curnode->next;
		free(curnode);
		curnode = nextnode;
	}
	free(lst);
}
```

For more advanced list traversal functions, the technique of maintaining more than one node pointer is often necessary. It may take some practice and diagrams to master this technique.

For extra practice, consider this slightly different implementation:

```C
void list_destroy(struct llist *lst) {
	struct llnode *curnode = lst->front;
	while (curnode) {
		struct llnode *backup = curnode;
		curnode = curnode->next;
		free(backup);
	}
	free(lst);
}
```

With a recursive approach, it is more convenient to free the rest of list before we `free` the first node.

```C
void free_nodes(struct llnode *node) {
	if (node) {
		free_nodes(node->next);
		free(node);
	}
}

void list_destroy(struct llist *lst) {
	free_nodes(lst->front);
	free(lst);
}
```

#### Duplicating a list

Previously, we used the "square list" function to illustrate the differences between the functional and imperative paradigms.

```C
// list_sqr(lst) squares each item in lst
// effects: modifies lst

void list_sqr(struct llist *lst) {
	struct llnode *node = lst->front;
	while (node) {
		node->item *= node->item;
		node = node->next;
	}
}
```

But what if we do want a new list that is squared instead of mutating an existing one?

One solution is to provide a `list_dup` function, that makes a duplicate of an existing list.

The recursive function is the most straightforward.

```C
void node_dup(struct llnode *node, struct llist *newlist) {
	if (node) {
		node_dup(node->next, newlist);
		add_front(node->item, newlist);
	}
}

struct llist *list_dup(struct llist *oldlist) {
	struct llist *newlist = list_create();
	node_dup(oldlist->front, newlist);
	return newlist;
}
```

The iterative solution is more complicated:

```C
struct llist *list_dup(struct llist *oldlist) {
	struct llist *newlist = list_create();
	struct llnode *oldnode = oldlist->front;
	struct llnode *prevnode = NULL;
	while (oldnode) {
		struct llnode *newnode = malloc(sizeof(struct llnode));
		newnode->item = oldnode->item;
		newnode->next = NULL;
		if (prevnode) {
			prevnode->next = newnode;
		} else {
			newlist->front = newnode;
		}
		prevnode = newnode;
		oldnode = oldnode->next;
	}
	return newlist;
}
```

#### Imperative insert

Earlier, we saw how the Racket (functional) implementation of insert would be problematic in C.

For an `insert` function in C, we expect the following behavior:

![racket insert](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg26_1.PNG)

```C
insert( 5, a);
insert(30, a);
```

![racket insert](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg26_2.PNG)

```C
// insert(i, slst) inserts i into list slst
// effects: modifies slst
// time: O(n), where n is the length of slst

void insert(int i, struct llist *slst) {
	if (slst->front == NULL || i < slst->front->item) {
		add_front(i, slst);
	} else {
		struct llnode *prevnode = slst->front;
		while (prevnode->next && i > prevnode->next->item) {
			prevnode = prevnode->next;
		}
		struct llnode *newnode = malloc(sizeof(struct llnode));
		newnode->item = i;
		newnode->next = prevnode->next;
		prevnode->next = newnode;
	}
}
```

#### Removing nodes

In Racket, the `rest` function does not actually remove the first element, instead it provides a pointer to the next node.

In C, we can implement a function that removes the first node.

```C
int remove_front(struct llist *lst) {
	assert(lst->front);
	int retval = lst->front->item;
	struct llnode *backup = lst->front;
	lst->front = lst->front->next;
	free(backup);
	return retval;
}
```

Instead of returning nothing (`void`), it is more useful to return the value of the item being removed.

Removing a node from an arbitrary list position is more complicated.

```C
// remove_item(i, lst) removes the first occurrence of i in lst
//   return value indicates if item is successfully removed

bool remove_item(int i, struct llist *lst) {
	if (lst->front == NULL) return false;
	if (lst->front->item == i) {
		remove_front(lst);
		return true;
	}
	struct llnode *prevnode = lst->front;
	while (prevnode->next && i != prevnode->next->item) {
		prevnode = prevnode->next;
	}
	if (prevnode->next == NULL) return false;
	struct llnode *backup = prevnode->next;
	prevnode->next = prevnode->next->next;
	free(backup);
	return true;
}
```

#### Revisiting the wrapper approach

Throughout these slides we have used a **wrapper** strategy, where we wrap the link to the first node inside of another structure (`llist`).

Some of the advantages of this strategy are:
*	cleaner function interfaces
*	reduced need for double pointers
*	reinforces the imperative paradigm
*	less susceptible to misuse and list corruption

The disadvantages of the wrapper approach include:
*	slightly more awkward recursive implementations
*	extra "special case" code around the first term

However, there is one more significant advantage of the wrapper approach: **additional information** can be stored in the list structure.

Consider that we are writing an application where the `length` of a linked list will be queried often.

Typically, finding the length of a linked list is $O(n)$.

However, we can store (or "cache") the length in the wrapper structure, so the length can be retrieved in $O(1)$ time.

```C
struct llist {
	struct llnode *front;
	int length;
};
```

Naturally, other list functions would have to update the `length` as necessary
*	`list_create` would initialize length to zero
*	`add_front` would increment length
*	`remove_front` would decrement length

#### Data integrity

The introduction of the `length` field to the linked list may seem like a great idea to improve efficiency.

However, it introduces new ways that the structure can be corrupted. What if the `lenth` field does not accurately reflect the true length?

For example, imagine that someone implements the `remove_item` function, but forgets to update the `length` field?

Or a naive coder may think that the following statement removes all of the codes from the list.

```C
lst->length = 0;
```

**Whenever the same information is stored in more than one way, it is susceptible to integrity (consistency) issues.**

Advanced testing methods can often find these types of errors, but you must exercise caution.

If data integrity is an issue, it is often better to repackage the data structure as a separate ADT module and only provide interface functions to the client.

This is an example of **security** (protecting the client from themselves).

#### Queue ADT

A queue is like a "lineup", where new items go to the "back" of the line, and the items are removed from the "front" of the line. While a stack is LIFO, a queue is FIFO (first in, first out).

Typical queue ADT operations:
*	`add_back`: adds an item to the end of the queue
*	`remove_front`: removes the item at the front of the queue
*	`front`: returns the item at the front
*	`is_empty`: determines if the queue is empty

A Stack ADT can be easily implemented using a dynamic array or with a linked list.

When it is possible to implement a Queue ADT with a dynamic array, the implementation is a bit tricky. Queues are typically implemented with linked lists.

The only concern is that an add_back operation is normally $O(n)$.

However, if we maintain a pointer to the back (last element) of the list, in addition to a pointer to the front of the list, we can implement `add_back` in $O(1)$.

>Maintaining a `back` pointer is a popular modification to a traditional linked list, and another reason to use a wrapper.

```C
// queue.h
// all operations are O(1) (except destroy)

struct queue;

struct queue *queue_create(void);

void queue_add_back(int i, struct queue *q);

int queue_remove_front(struct queue *q);

int queue_front(struct queue *q);

bool queue_is_empty(struct queue *q);

void queue_destroy(struct queue *q);
```

```C
// queue.c (IMPLEMENTATION)

struct llnode {
	int item;
	struct llnode *next;
};

struct queue {
	struct llnode *front;
	struct llnode *back;
};

struct queue *queue_create(void) {
	struct queue *q = malloc(sizeof(struct queue));
	q->front = NULL;
	q->back = NULL;
	return q;
}

void queue_add_back(int i, struct queue *q) {
	struct llnode *node = malloc(sizeof(struct llnode));
	node->item = i;
	node->next = NULL;
	if (q->front == NULL) {
		q->front = node;
	} else {
		q->back->next = node;
	}
	q->back = node;
}

int queue_remove_front (struct queue *q) {
	assert(q->front);
	int retval = q->front->item;
	struct llnode *backup = q->front;
	q->front = q->front->next;
	free(backup);
	if (q->front == NULL) q->back = NULL;
	return retval;
}

int queue_front(struct queue *q) {
	assert(q->front);
	return q->front->item;
}
bool queue_is_empty(struct queue *q) {
	return q->front == NULL;
}
void queue_destroy(struct queue *q) {
	while (!queue_is_empty(q)) {
		queue_remove_front(q);
	}
	free(q);
}
```

#### Node augmentation strategy

In an **node augmentation strategy**, each node is augmented to include additional information about the node or the structure.

For example, a **dictionary** node can contain both a *key* (item) and a corresponding *value*.

Or for a **priority queue**, each node can additionally store the priority of the item.

The most common node augmentation for a linked list is to create a **double linked list**, where each node also contains a pointer to the previous node. When combined with `back` pointer in a wrapper, a double linked list can add or remove from the front and back in $O(1)$ time.

![double linked list](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg43.PNG)

Many programming environments provide a Double-Ended Queue (dequeue or deque) ADT, which can be used as a stack or a Queue ADT.

#### Trees

At the implementation level, **trees** are very similar to linked lists.

Each node can *link* to more than one node.

![tree](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg44.PNG)

#### Tree terminology

*	the **root node** has no **parent**
*	all other nodes have exactly one parent
*	nodes can have multiple **children**
*	in a **binary tree**, each node has at most two children
*	a **leaf node** has no children
*	the **height** of a tree is the maximum possible number of nodes from the root to a leaf (inclusive)B
*	the height of an empty tree is zero

#### Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

Binary Search Tree (BST) enforce the **ordering property**: for every node with an item $i$, all items in the left child subtree are less than $i$, and all items in the right child subtree are greater than $i$.

![tree](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg44.PNG)

#### Mixing paradigms

As with linked lists, we have to be careful not to mix functional and imperative paradigms, especially when adding nodes. The following example visualizes what Racket produces when a node (45) is added to the BST illustrated earlier.

![racket tree](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg47.PNG)

Our BST node (`bstnode`) is very similar to our linked list node definition.

```C
struct bstnode {
	int item;
	struct bstnode *left;
	struct bstnode *right;
};

struct bst {
	struct bstnode *root;
};
```

As with linked lists, we will need a function to create a new BST.

```C
// bst_create() creates a new BST
// effects: allocates memory: call bst_destroy
struct bst *bst_create(void) {
	struct bst *t = malloc(sizeof(struct bst));
	t->root = NULL;
	return t;
}
```

Before writing code to insert a new node, first we write a helper to create a new leaf node.

```C
struct bstnode *new_leaf(int i) {
	struct bstnode *leaf = malloc(sizeof(struct bstnode));
	leaf->item = i;
	leaf->left = NULL;
	leaf->right = NULL;
	return leaf;
}
```

As with lists, we can write tree functions recursively or iteratively.

Wee need to **recurse** on nodes. This code emulates a functional approach, but is careful to only allocate one new (leaf) node.

```C
struct bstnode *insert_bstnode(int i, struct bstnode *node) {
	if (node == NULL) {
		node = new_leaf(i);
	} else if (i < node->item) {
		node->left = insert_bstnode(i, node->left);
	} else if (i > node->item) {
		node->right = insert_bstnode(i, node->right);
	} // else do nothing, as item already exists.
	return node;
}

void bst_insert(int i, struct bst *t) {
	t->root = insert_bstnode(i, t->root);
}
```

The iterative version is similar to the linked list approach.

```C
void bst_insert(int i, struct bst *t) {
	struct bstnode *curnode = t->root;
	struct bstnode *prevnode = NULL;
	while (curnode) {
		if (curnode->item == i) return;
		prevnode = curnode;
		if (i < curnode->item) {
			curnode = curnode->left;
		} else {
			curnode = curnode->right;
		}
	}
	if (prevnode == NULL) { // tree was empty
		t->root = new_leaf(i);
	} else if (i < prevnode->item) {
		prevnode->left = new_leaf(i);
	} else {
		prevnode->right = new_leaf(i);
	}
}
```

#### Trees and efficiency

What is the efficiency of `bst_insert`?

The worst case is when the tree is **unbalanced**, and every node in the tree must be visited.

![unbalanced](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg54.PNG)

In this example, the running time of `bst_insert` is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree.

The running time of `bst_insert` is $O(h)$: it depends more on the height of the tree (h) than the size of the tree (n),

The definition of a **balanced tree** is a tree where the height (h) is $O(\log n)$.

Conversely, an unbalanced tree is a tree with a height that is not $O(\log n)$. The height of an unbalanced tree is $O(n)$.

Using the `bst_insert` function we provided, inserting the nodes in sorted order creates an unbalanced tree.

With a **balanced** tree, the running time of standard tree functions (e.g. `insert`, `remove`, `search`) are all $O(\log n)$.

With an **unbalanced** tree, the running time of each function is $O(h)$.

A **self-balancing tree** "re-arranges" the nodes to ensure that tree is always balanced.

With a good self-balancing implementation, all standard tree functions preserve the balance of the tree and have an $O(\log n)$ running time.

#### Size node augmentation

A popular tree **node augmentation** is to store in each node the size of its subtree.

```C
struct bstnode {
	int item;
	struct bstnode *left;
	struct bstnode *right;
	int size;d
};
```

This augmentation allows us to retrieve the size of the tree in $O(1)$ time.

It also allows us to implement a `select` function in $O(h)$ time.

`select(k)` finds the k-th smallest item in the tree.

![size node augmentation](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg58.PNG)

The following code illustrate how to select the k-th item in a BST with a size node augmentation.

```C
int select_node(int k, struct bstnode *node) {
	assert(node && 0 <= k && k < node->size);
	int left_size = 0;
	if (node->left) left_size = node->left->size;
	if (k < left_size) return select_node(k, node->left);
	if (k == left_size) return node->item;
	return select_node(k - left_size - 1, node->right);
}

int bst_select(int k, struct bst *t) {
	return select_node(k, t->root);
}
```

`select(0, t)` finds the smallest item in the tree.

#### Array-based trees

For some types of trees, it is possible to use an **array** to store a tree.
*	the root is stored at `a[0]`
*	for the node at `a[i]`, its `left` is stored at `a[2*i+1]`
*	its `right` is stored at `a[2*i+2]`
*	its `parent` is stored at `a[(i-1)/2]`
*	a special *sentinel value* can be used to indicate an empty node
*	a tree of height $h$ requires an array of size $2^h-1$
(a dynamic array can be realloc'd as the tree height grows)

![array based tree](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg61.PNG)

>Array-based trees are often used to implement “complete trees”,
where there are no empty nodes, and every level of the tree is
filled (except the bottom).
The heap data structure (not the section of memory) is often
implemented as a complete tree in an array.
For self-balancing trees, the self-balancing (e.g., rotations) is
often more awkward in the array notation. However, arrays work
well with lazy rebalancing, where a rebalancing occurs
infrequently (i.e., when a large imbalance is detected). The tree
can be rebalanced in $O(n)$ time, typically achieving amortized
$O(log n)$ operations.

#### Dictionary ADT (revisited)

The dictionary ADT (also called a map, associative array, or symbol
table), is a collection of **pairs** of **keys** and **values**. Each key is unique and has a corresponding value, but more than one key may have the same value.

Typical dictionary ADT operations:
*	**look up**: for a given key, retrieve the corresponding value or "not found"
*	**insert**: adds a new key/value pair (or replaces the value of an existing key)
*	**remove**: deletes a key and its value

In the following example, we implement a Dictionary ADT using a BST data structure.

```C
// dictionary.h

struct dictionary;
struct dictionary *dict_create(void);
void dict_insert(int key, const char *val, struct dictionary *d);
const char *dict_lookup(int key, struct dictionary *d);
void dict_remove(int key, struct dictionary *d);
void dict_destroy(struct dictionary *d);
```

Using the same `bstnode` structure, we augment each node by adding an additional `value` field.

```C
struct bstnode {
	int item; // key
	char *value; // additional value
	struct bstnode *left;
	struct bstnode *right;
};
struct dictionary {
	struct bstnode *root;
};
struct dictionary *dict_create(void) {
	struct dictionary *d = malloc(sizeof(struct dictionary));
	d->root = NULL;
	return d;
}
```

When inserting key/value pairs to the dictionary, we make a copy of the string passed by the client. When removing nodes, we also `free` the value.

If the client tries to insert a duplicate key, we replace the old value with the new value.

The following recursive implementation of the `insert` operation is nearly identical to our previous `bst_insert`. The differences are noted with comments.

```C
struct bstnode *insert_bstnode(int key, const char *val, struct bstnode *node) {
	if (node == NULL) {
		node = malloc(sizeof(struct bstnode));
		node->item = key;
		node->value = my_strdup(val); // make copy
		node->left = NULL;
		node->right = NULL;
	} else if (key < node->item) {
		node->left = insert_bstnode(key, val, node->left);
	} else if (key > node->item) {
		node->right = insert_bstnode(key, val, node->right);
	} else { // key == node->item: must replace the old value
		free(node->value);
		node->value = my_strdup(val);
	}
	return node;
}

void dict_insert(int key, const char *val, struct dictionary *d) {
	d->root = insert_bstnode(key, val, d->root);
}
```

This implementation of the `lookup` operation will return `NULL` if unsuccessful.

```C
const char *dict_lookup(int key, struct dictionary *d) {
	struct bstnode *curnode = d->root;
	while (curnode) {
		if (curnode->item == key) {
			return curnode->value;
		}
		if (key < curnode->item) {
			curnode = curnode->left;
		} else {
			curnode = curnode->right;
		}
	}
	return NULL;
}
```

There are several different ways of removing a node from a BST.

We implement `remove` with the following strategy:
*	If the node with the key ("key node") is a leaf, we remove it.
*	If one child of the key node is empty (`NULL`), the other child is "promoted" to replace the key node.
*	Otherwise, we find the node with the next largest key ("next node") in the tree (i.e. the smallest key in the right subtree). We replace the key/value of the key node with the key/value of the next node, and then remove the next node from the right subtree.

```C
void dict_remove(int key, struct dictionary *d) {
	d->root = remove_bstnode(key, d->root);
}

struct bstnode *remove_bstnode(int key, struct bstnode *node) {
	// key did not exist:
	if (node == NULL) return NULL;

	// search for the node that contains the key
	if (key < node->item) {
		node->left = remove_bstnode(key, node->left);
	} else if (key > node->item) {
		node->right = remove_bstnode(key, node->right);
	} else if (node->left == NULL) {
		struct bstnode *backup = node->right;
		free(node->value);
		free(node);
		return backup;
	} else if (node->right == NULL) {
		struct bstnode *backup = node->left;
		free(node->value);
		free(node);
		return backup;
	} else {
		// find the next largest key
		struct bstnode *next = node->right;
		while (next->left) {
			next = next->left;
		}

		// remove the old value
		free(node->value);

		// replace the key/value of this node
		node->item = next->item;
		node->value = my_strdup(next->value);

		// remove the next largest key
		node->right = remove_bstnode(next->item, node->right);
	}

	return node;
}
```

Finally, the recursive `destroy` operation frees the children and the (string) value before itself.

```C
void free_bstnode(struct bstnode *node) {
	if (node) {
		free_bstnode(node->left);
		free_bstnode(node->right);
		free(node->value);
		free(node);
	}
}
void dict_destroy(struct dictionary *d) {
	free_bstnode(d->root);
	free(d);
}
```

#### Graphs
Linked lists and trees can be thought of as “special cases” of a
**graph** data structure.

![graphs](http://tonyli.tk/notes/cs136/sec11pg74.PNG)

Graphs link **nodes** with **edges**. Graphs may be undirected (i) or
directed (ii), allow cycles (ii) or be acyclic (iii), and have labeled
edges (iv) or unlabeled edges (iii).

#### Goals of this section
At the end of this section, you should be able to:
*	use the new linked list and tree terminology introduced
*	use linked lists and trees with a recursive or iterative approach
*	use wrapper structures and node augmentations to improve
efficiency
*	explain why an unbalanced tree can affect the efficiency of tree
