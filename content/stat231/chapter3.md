# Chapter 3: Planning and Conducting Empirical Studies

## 3.1 Empirical Studies

An empirical study is one which is carried out to learn about a population or process by collecting data. We have given several examples in the preceding two chapters but we have not yet considered the details of such studies. In this chapter we consider how to conduct an empirical study in a systematic way. Well-conducted empirical studies are needed to produce maximal information within existing cost and time constraints. A poorly planned or executed study can be worthless or even misleading. For example, in the field of medicine thousands of empirical studies are conducted every year at very high costs to society and with critical consequences. These investigations must be well planned and executed so that the knowledge they produce is useful, reliable and obtained at reasonable cost.

It is helpful to think of planning and conducting a study as a set of steps. We describe below the set of steps to which we assign the acronym PPDAC.

*	Problem: a clear statement of the study's objectives, usually involving one or more questions
*	Plan: the procedures used to carry out the study including how we will collect the data
*	Data: the physical collection of the data, as described in the Plan
*	Analysis: the analysis of the data collected in light of the Problem and the Plane
*	Conclusion: the conclusions that are drawn about the Problem and their limitations

PPDAC has been designed to emphasize the statistical aspects of empirical studies.

## 3.2 The Steps of PPDAC

### 1 Problem

The elements of the problem address questions starting with "what"

*	what conclusion are we trying to draw?
*	what group of things or people do we want the conclusions to apply?
*	what variates can we define?
*	what is the question we are trying to answer?

#### Types of Problems

Three common types of statistical problems that are encountered are described below.

*	**Descriptive**: the problem is to determine a particular attribute of a population. Much of the function of official statistical agencies such as Statistics Canada involves problems of this type. For example, the government needs to know the national unemployment rate and whether it has increased or decreased over the past month.
*	**Causative**: the problem is to determine the existence or non-existence of causal relationship between two variates.
*	**Predictive**: the problem is to predict the response of a variate for a given unit. This is often the case in finance or in economics.

In the second types of problem, the experimenter is interested in whether one variate $x$ tends to cause an increase or a decrease in another variate $Y$. Where possible this is conducted in a controlled experiment in which $x$ is increased to decreased while holding everything else in the experiment constant and we observe the changes in $Y$. As indicated in Chapter 1, an experiment in which the experimenter manipulates the values of the explanatory variates is referred to as an **experimental study**. On the other hand in the study of whether second-hand smoke causes asthma, it is unlikely that the experimenter would be able to manipulate the explanatory variate and so the experimenter needs to rely on a potentially less informative **observational study**, one that depends on data that is collected without the ability to control explanatory variates.

#### Defining the problem

The first step in describing the problem is to define the units and the target population or target process.

#### Definition 14

The **target population** or process is the collection of units to which the experimenters conducting the empirical study wish the conclusions to apply.

#### Definition 15

A **variate** is a characteristic associated with each unit.

#### Definition 16

An **attribute** is a function of the variate over a population.

### 2 Plan

In most cases, we cannot calculate the attributes of interest for the target population directly because we can only examine a subset of the units in the target population. This may be due to lack of resources and time, as in the smoking survey or physical impossibility as in the can-filling study where we can only look at cans available now and not in the future. Or, in an even more difficult situation, we may be forced to carry out a clinical trial using mice because it is unethical to use humans and so we do not examine any units in the target population. Obviously there will be uncertainty in our answers. The purpose of the plane step is to decide what units we will examine, what data we will connect and how we will do so.

#### Definition 17

The **study population** or **study process** is the collection of units available to be included in the study.

#### Definition 18

If the attributes in the study population differ from the attributes in the target population then the difference is called **study error**.

#### Definition 19

The sampling protocol is the procedure used to select a sample of units from the study population. The number of units sampled is called the **sample size**.

#### Definition 20

If the attributes in the sample differ from the attributes in the study population the difference is called **sample error**.

#### Definition 21

If the measured value and the true value of a variate are not identical the difference is called **measurement error**.

### 3 Data

The object of the data step is to collect the data according to the plan. Any deviations from the plan should be notes. The data must be stored in away that facilitates the analysis.

The previous sections noted the need to define variates clearly and to have satisfactory methods of measuring them.

*	Mistakes can occur in recording or entering data into a data base. For complex investigations, it is useful to put checks in place to avoid these mistakes.
*	In many studies the units must be tracked and measured over a long period of time
*	When data are recorded over time or in different locations, the time and place for each measurement should be recorded.
*	There may be departures from the study plan that arise over time. (e.g. persons may drop out of a long term medical study because of adverse reactions to a treatment it may take longer than anticipated to collect the data so the number of units sampled must be reduced.)
*	In some studies the amount of data may be extremely large, so data base design and management is important.

#### Missing data and response bias

Suppose we wish to conduct a study to determine if ethnic residents of a city are satisfied with police service in their neighbourhood. A questionnaire is prepared. A sample of 300 mailing addresses in a predominantly ethnic neighbourhood is chosen and a uniformed police officer is sent to each address to interview an adult resident. Is there a possible bias in this study? It is likely that those who are strong supporters of the police are quite happy to respond but those with misgivings about the police will either choose not to respond at all or change some of their responses to favour the police. This type of bias is called response bias. When those that do respond have a somewhat different characteristics than the population at large, the quality of the data is threatened, especially when the response rate (the proportion who do respond to the survey) is lower. 

### 4 Analysis

In Chapter 1 we discussed different methods of summarizing the data using numerical and graphical summaries. A key step in formal analyses is the selection of an appropriate model that can describe the data and how it was collected. In Chapter 2 we discussed methods for checking the t of the model. We also need to describe the Problem in terms of the model parameters and properties. You will see many more formal analyses in subsequent chapters.

### 5 Conclusions

The purpose of the Conclusion step is to answer the questions posed in the Problem. In other words, the Conclusion is directed by the Problem. An attempt should be made to quantify (or at least discuss) potential errors as described in the Plan step and any limitations to the conclusions.
