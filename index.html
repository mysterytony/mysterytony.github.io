                                        <p>
                                            I started learning programming since I was in secondary school with tutorials, courses, and books. As my programming knowledge grew, I became a senior leader in my secondary school's computer club. We have been experimenting on various projects. The Pomodoro Technique Helper, a productivity tool, is the most vivid demonstration of both our programming skill and teamwork. I also attended CCC held by Waterloo in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and received a full mark in 2014 (junior) and 44 out of 75 in 2015 (top 25% in senior).

                                        <p>
                                            As I was in the co-op program in 2014, Professor David Ng, a biologist in UBC recruited students to draw bio cards for his project Phylomon, a trading card game. He recruited me to develop an iOS wiki APP, PhyloBox, which was much more challenging than mere basic computer task. I worked with Dr. Ng and learned from other computer science students in the Michael Smith Lab during the day. In the night I debugged and improved the functionalities of the APP. I overcame various problems and successfully published the PhyloBox in the APP Store. Dr. Ng was impressed and hired me to further polish the APP.

                                            These experiences boosted my interest in programming and ignited my passion in computer science. My goal is to be a software engineer, a professor or an entrepreneur. I believe the University of Waterloo is the best platform for me to learn, grow and contribute to the computer field. As my dream of studying with the world topnotch professors and researchers in Waterloo is realized, I will do my best to master as much as there is to learn about programming and contribute my share to the field.

                                <br /> May 2014 – May 2014 | Vancouver, BC
                                <br /> Our career counselor recommended a computer co-op position at the Michael Smith Lab, UBC, to me. Dr. David Ng, a professor in biology, accepted me. I thought our duties would probably be just data entry, word processing, or simple programming. Actually, Professor Ng entrusted students from high schools as well as elementary schools to draw more than 400 bio cards with introductions and as a first step of his project Phylomon, a trading card game, he recruited students with high-tech skills to develop an iOS wiki APP, PhyloBox. My lack of mobile programming experience made the project a challenge to me. The development of the APP, either for its programming language or for its programming features, was all new to me. But I worked and learned day and night both in his lab and at home. In the end I overcame the challenge and successfully developed the PhyloBox, and published it in the APP Store.
